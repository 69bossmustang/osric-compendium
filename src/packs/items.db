{"_id":"1IXXtqAO16rYbtxA","name":"Cleric","type":"class","img":"icons/skills/trades/academics-merchant-scribe.webp","data":{"description":"\n\t\t\t\t<p>Clerics are moral and spiritual leaders, warriors of faith who preach the will of the gods, interpret omens and portents, and strike down the evil or unfaithful. Most clerics have a patron deity, but some are champions of a particular moral alignment, venerating all deities of that alignment in addition to a patron deity, and yet others are the servants of a particular pantheon of deities. In a world of swords and sorcery, force of arms often speaks louder than moral suasion, and clerics are trained to do battle against the enemies of their gods. Some clerics are fanatics, zealously seeking new converts or hunting heretics. Others seem almost burdened by an inconvenient or even oppressive relationship with the divine forces. Evil clerics - sinister villains who prey upon fear and jealousy - sow discord in the world and gather converts for their demonic masters.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Clerics play an important support role for an adventuring party. Most clerical spells are oriented toward healing, strengthening, and defending others. However, when the need arises the cleric is fully capable of taking a place in the line of battle and smiting down infidels and foes. Clerics employ their holy symbols rather than spell books as a focus for their meditation. Cleric spells are automatically acquired as the cleric gains levels and no check is necessary to ensure they are understood; thus clerics may normally memorise any spell appropriate to their level. However, in some circumstances the powers the cleric serves may intervene and grant different spells to those requested; it is suggested that this is only done in extreme cases (such as when the cleric has been guilty of an alignment transgression of some kind, for example; more serious transgressions may result in fewer spells being granted, or even none at all). Some GMs may permit clerics of specific deities to have slightly different abilities from those described here.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>When a cleric attains ninth level, he or she has accumulated sufficient divine favour and mortal renown to found a temple/stronghold. Such places are normally carved from the wilderness, in the same manner as a fighter establishes a freehold. For a cleric to assume the leadership of an existing temple, the details are left to the discretion of the GM; a level somewhat higher than ninth might be required. Whether the cleric estab-lishes a stronghold or a temple, followers and acolytes will flock to the cleric's banner.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Minimum Scores: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Str 6, Dex 3, Con 6, Int 6, Wis 9, Cha 6</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Hit Die Type: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>d8 (max 9)</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Alignment: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Any</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Experience bonus: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Wisdom 16+</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Armour/Shield Permitted: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Any</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Weapons Permitted: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Blunt only - club, flail, hammer, mace, oil, staff; clerics may hurl hammers, clubs, or oil, but may not employ other missile weapons</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Weapon Proficiencies: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>2 + 1 every 3 levels</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Penalty to hit for non-proficiency: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>-3</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Weapon Specialisation: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>N/A</p>\n\t\t\t\t<h1>Cleric Class Abilities</h1>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Spell Casting: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Clerics may memorise and cast clerical spells in accordance with the tables provided hereafter.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Turning Undead: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Clerics can \"turn\" the undead, making them flee from the cleric's holiness (or, in the case of an evil cleric, bringing them to heel as servants and minions).

The chest itself must be crafted of the finest materials in order to support the spell's magic, and it will cost a minimum of 5,000 gp to have a craftsman or craftsmen build it, together with a second, miniature copy. When the magic user casts the spell, one hand upon the chest and one upon the miniature, the chest disappears into the æthereal plane, together with its contents. These contents may be up to one cubic foot of material per caster level (and no more than this) regardless of the chest's actual volume. If the chest contains any living matter, there is a 75% chance that the spell will completely fail, although if it should succeed, the living creature will be imprisoned in the æthereal plane until freed. The caster (and only the caster) can use the miniature chest to pull the larger one from the æther wherever he or she might be. It is possible, although not likely, that some æthereal creature or æthereal traveller might happen upon the chest while it is in the æthereal plane. So long as the chest remains in the æthereal plane, the magic user will still be able to retrieve it (although it may have been looted). No creature on the material plane has any chance using any magic known to humanity to locate a secret chest that has been hidden in the æthereal plane by means of this spell. After the spell duration expires, there is a cumulative 1 in 20 chance per day that the spell's link to the chest will fail, and the chest will be irrecoverable.</p>\n\t\t\t","dmonlytext":"","itemList":[],"attributes":{"rarity":"","type":"","subtype":"","magic":false,"properties":[],"identified":true},"charges":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":0},"location":{"state":"carried","parent":""},"resource":{"itemId":""},"actions":[{"img":"icons/weapons/staves/staff-ornate-red.webp","ability":"none","type":"cast","targeting":"","successAction":"none","formula":"","otherdmg":[],"effectList":[],"effect":{"duration":{"formula":"","type":"round"},"changes":[]},"speed":99,"damagetype":"slashing","resource":{"type":"none","itemId":"","reusetime":"","count":{"cost":1,"min":0,"max":1,"value":0}},"magicpotency":0,"properties":[],"dmonlytext":"","itemList":[],"saveCheck":{"type":"none","formula":""},"abilityCheck":{"type":"none","formula":""},"id":"5gjzpyyotputcsjp","index":0,"name":"Secret Chest"},{"img":"icons/magic/time/hourglass-yellow-green.webp","ability":"none","type":"effect","targeting":"","successAction":"none","formula":"","otherdmg":[],"effectList":[],"effect":{"duration":{"formula":"+60","type":"day"},"changes":[{"key":"Secret Chest","value":"SPELL","mode":0}]},"speed":99,"damagetype":"slashing","resource":{"type":"none","itemId":"","reusetime":"","count":{"cost":1,"min":0,"max":1,"value":0}},"magicpotency":0,"properties":[],"dmonlytext":"","itemList":[],"saveCheck":{"type":"none","formula":""},"abilityCheck":{"type":"none","formula":""},"id":"krjvsq5gfzctogfp","index":1,"name":"Secret Chest"}],"quantity":0,"weight":0,"cost":{"value":0,"currency":"gp"},"source":"OSRIC","xp":0,"audio":{"effect":"","success":"","failure":""},"type":"Arcane","level":"5","school":"Transmutation, Alteration","sphere":"MU","range":"See below","components":{"verbal":true,"somatic":true,"material":true},"materials":{"value":null,"consumed":false,"cost":0,"count":0},"durationText":"60 days","castingTime":"1 turn","areaOfEffect":"One chest or box, 12 cubic ft","save":"None"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"I0IQ9ef7ZhLd66iw":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"e05cc8a33ecd4fb27e80aa274655dec83e7c6cc0","sourceId":"Item.7dlLFGRJOtmObt09"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.OSRIC4_PC-spell-compendium.7dlLFGRJOtmObt09"},"cf":{"id":"temp_j2n3664edq","path":"OSRIC-PC#/CF_SEP/Spells","color":"#000000"}}}

Illusionists are dependent upon their spell books, and can only normally cast spells they have learned from these books (exception: spells may be cast from illusionist scrolls). Acquisition of new spells is difficult and demanding, and must normally be accomplished through adventuring, although illusionists will automatically receive one new spell of the highest spell level that he or she may cast upon completing training after acquiring a new level of experience.

Indeed, a familiar can also be of considerable benefit to a lower level magic user (even increasing others' estimation of his or her power), but the risks inherent in losing a familiar can be daunting to a weaker spell caster. To summon a familiar, the magic user must intone the words of the spell over a well-stocked fire source, sprinkling the flames with expensive incense and powders (100 gp in total value).</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The caster must maintain his or her casting for as long as necessary ([[/roll 2d12]] hours) until a familiar arrives (or the casting time expires without success).

Normal familiars have [[/roll 1d3+1]] hit points, are AC 7, and are as intelligent as a lowerthan-average human.

This veneer, like many things pertaining to the assassins, is deceptive; survival in the higher echelons of an assassins' guild requires animal cunning and a complete absence of mercy. Assassin characters must begin with an evil alignment.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Virtually all cities (and many towns) will have a guild of assassins operating within the city walls and in the surrounding region, made up of 6-24 assassins of varying level. Player character assassins, if they are identified by the local guild, will be invited to join (such invitations ranging from polite to violent). Joining a guild places the assassin under the command of the local guildmaster, which may be inconvenient (and will require the assassin to pay a share of his take to the guild), but assassins' guilds take a very dim view of freelancers working in their territory. Freelance assassins - and their companions - do not ordinarily live to enjoy old age. There are, of course, benefits to joining such a guild; training costs may be reduced, and the guild may be a good source of information about potential missions or nearby enemies.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Assassins' guilds are controlled by a guildmaster of 14th level - an assassin of lower level might take control, but would be unable to inspire the fear necessary to keep rival guilds from forming. To gain 14th level, an assassin character must take control of an assassins' guild by killing (directly or indirectly) the existing guildmaster. Whenever the control of an assassins' guild changes hands, most of the assassins will abandon the guild and depart the area, normally leaving the guild reduced to a quarter of its original membership.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The grandmaster of assassins (a campaign may have one or more) is a figure of legend and fear. These dark eminences usually live far from the cities, in remote and well-guarded locations - their fame is such that those who need their services will seek them out. To advance to 15th level, an assassin must find and kill one of the existing grandmasters.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Minimum Scores: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Str 12, Dex 12, Con 6, Int 11, Wis 6</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Hit Die Type: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>d6 (max 15)</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Alignment: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Any evil</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Experience bonus: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>None</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Armour/Shield Permitted: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Leather or studded leather only (shields allowed)</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Weapons Permitted: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Any</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Weapon Proficiencies: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>3 + 1 every 4 levels</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Penalty to hit for non-proficiency: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>-3</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Weapon Specialisation: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>N/A</p>\n\t\t\t\t<h1>Assassin Class Abilities</h1>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Assassination: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>If an assassin gains surprise (see \"Combat\") he or she may elect to assassinate the victim. The assassin need not roll to hit for an assassination attempt, which is a special attack resulting in a chance to kill the victim instantly and ensure damage even if the victim is not successfully killed. The percentage chance to kill a victim is 50%, with a bonus of 5% per level of the assassin and a penalty of 5% for every two levels of the target (rounding down; in the case of monsters, substitute \"hit dice\" for \"level\"). These numbers are approximate, for the GM should modify the assassin's chances slightly upward or downward according to the circumstances - guarded or wary targets are less likely to be killed, and unwary victims are more likely to die. If the assassination attempt does not succeed, the attack still inflicts normal damage, together with any applicable bonuses. The assassin does not gain backstab multiple damage on a failed assassination attempt, even if the assassination attempt was made from behind.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Backstab: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>An assassin may backstab with any of the melee weapons permissible to the thief class. Backstabbing doubles the weapon's damage at levels 1-4, triple at levels 5-8, quadruple at level 9-12, and so on. Also, an assassin attacks from behind with a bonus to hit of +4 rather than the ordinary +2.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Disguise: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Assassins are masters of disguise. Within reasonable limits, an assassin can make him- or herself appear slightly shorter or considerably taller, fatter or thinner, or of the opposite gender. An assassin can even disguise him- or herself as a member of another race (again, within reason). Any person observing the disguised assassin has a base 2% chance to see through the disguise, with one chance per day to do so. The base chance of seeing through a disguise increases another 2% if the assassin is posing as another class, race or gender (max 8% chance). The GM may assign additional penalties and bonuses to this check if the observer is unusually wise or intelligent (or particularly stupid), and common sense, of course, applies at all times.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Poison: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Assassins are not inherently better at using poison than any other character class capable of using poison, but generally have more opportunities to gain knowledge of poisons and their effects.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Thief Abilities: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>The assassin has thief abilities as a thief two levels below the assassin's level. At first level, the assassin has the thieving abilities of a first level thief, but does not gain the abilities of a second level thief until reaching fourth level.

{"_id":"XOeZw0tERccUCMf1","name":"Thief","type":"class","img":"icons/skills/trades/academics-merchant-scribe.webp","data":{"description":"\n\t\t\t\t<p>Thieves sneak furtively in the shadowed alleyways of cities, living by their wits. They are often members of the criminal underclass, usually trained by a thieves' guild in the arts of burglary and stealth. It is not uncommon for a thief to seek out the great rewards that can be gained from the adventuring life, especially when circumstances require lying low for a while.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Most thieves come from the teeming masses of a large city, wherein a thieves' guild is often the only source of justice and exercises as much power as the city's legitimate government. Of course, not all thieves are members of a guild. Some are freelancers, evading both the authorities and the guild, living on the edge of the knife. Some are even found working on the side of the law; agents or spies who use their skills in more accepted (though equally shadowy) pursuits. A thief character must be of any neutral or evil alignment. Neutral good thieves are permitted because of the neutral component of their alignment.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Sensible adventuring parties will almost always include a thief, for the skills of such a character are invaluable in reaching inaccessible places via climb walls, pick locks, and so on. In addition, dungeons frequently contain traps which must be located and disarmed, and the thief's cunning and stealth conspire to make him or her very useful in a scouting role.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Thieves in OSRIC are modelled on characters of fiction and legend, particularly characters from the works of Fritz Leiber and Jack Vance. Leiber's \"Lankhmar\" series is highly recommended, particularly for its description of the operation of a typical thieves' guild; but the high-level thief's ability to read (or misread) magic scrolls is a nod to Vance's Cugel.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Minimum Scores: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Str 6, Dex 9, Con 6, Int 6,Cha 6</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Hit Die Type: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>d6</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Initial Hit Die: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>1</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Alignment: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Any neutral or any evil</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Experience bonus: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Dex 16+</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Armour/Shield Permitted: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Leather or studded leather only, no shields</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Weapons Permitted: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Club, dagger, dart, oil, sling, single-handed swords (except bastard swords)</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Weapon Proficiencies: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>2 + 1 every 4 levels</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Penalty to hit for non-proficiency: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>-3</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Weapon Specialisation: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>N/A</p>\n\t\t\t\t<h1>Thief Class Abilities</h1>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Backstab: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>If the thief can approach his or her target unobserved and strike with a melee weapon, the attack is made at +4 to hit. Damage from a backstab is doubled - or trebled if the thief is of 5th level or higher. Thieves of 9th level or higher do quadruple damage, while those of 13th or greater level quintuple the number shown on the die. Damage modifiers (such as those pertaining to strength or magic) are not multiplied from a backstab.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Climb: Climbing represents a thief's ability to scale sheer walls and surfaces, cling to ceilings, and perform other feats of climbing that would normally be impossible. Climbing checks must ordinarily be repeated for every ten ft of climbing. Non-thieves cannot climb walls, cliffs, or any vertical surface without the use of a rope or magic, making the presence of a thief vital to many adventuring parties.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Find Traps: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>This ability represents the thief's minute visual inspection of a new area for tiny telltale signs that something of interest or danger may be concealed nearby. It requires a full turn (10 minutes) to accomplish.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Hide in Shadows: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Some shadow must be present for this ability to be used, but if the check is successful the thief is effectively invisible until he makes an attack or moves from the shadows. The ability can also be used to blend in with a crowd of people rather than disappear into shadows.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Move Quietly: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Use of this skill allows the thief to move with preternatural silence even over surfaces such as squeaky floors.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Open Locks/ Disarm Traps: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Opening locks and disarming traps (without springing them) is a skill unique to thieves, which cannot be successfully attempted by members of other classes. A thief can also set traps (with the same chance as to disarm).</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Pick Pockets: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>If the thief's pick pockets check fails by 20% or more, then his or her attempt has been discovered and the intended victim will almost always take hostile action</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Read Languages: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>The thief may attempt to read languages and ciphers of a non-magical nature only.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Thieves' Cant: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Thieves have their own language.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p/>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>Advanced Abilities</b>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Read Scrolls (10th): </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>When a thief reaches 10th level, he or she has become well-versed enough in training to cast spells from an arcane or phantasmal scroll (magic user or illusionist). However, this casting is not always successful. The thief should roll against his or her intelligence as a magic user or illusionist does, and if the score shown on the die is insufficient for the thief to cast the spell, then the casting will fail, possibly (at the GM's option) having some entirely unexpected effect.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Thief skills progress as the thief levels and are modified by dexterity and race as per these

A lengthy apprenticeship of study and practice allows these somewhat eerie individuals to store arcane energy within their minds and to release it in the form of spells. Magic users cast spells by speaking a few magic words, weaving complex gestures in the air, and employing rare and magical materials. While magic users (with illusionists) are the weakest character class in combat, this weakness is balanced by possessing the most powerful and versatile spells in the game.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The full underlying principles of magic are beyond mortal comprehension; even wizards of the profoundest intellect struggle from momentary inklings to understand its more complex patterns. Nevertheless, those character who possess formidable intelligence and a certain intuitive gift, who are willing to devote themselves to a lifetime of study, may in time sufficiently master the art to be capable of shifting mountains and shattering entire armies. High-level magic users are the most feared and dangerous characters in the game.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Magic users do not gain bonus spells for high intelligence scores; intelligence does determine which spells they can understand and how many spells they may learn for each spell level.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Magic users are dependent upon their spell books, and normally may only cast spell they have learned from these books (exception: magic users may cast spells from arcane magical scrolls). Mages may not cast spells from divine, druidic or phantasmal magic scrolls. The acquisition of a new spell is difficult and demanding and must normally be accomplished through adventuring, although the mage will automatically receive one new spell of the highest spell level that he or she may cast upon acquiring a new level of experience.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>OSRIC magic users are superficially similar to the wizards of fantasy literature such as Gandalf and Merlin, but they are more closely similar to mages described in the works of Jack Vance. His \"Dying Earth\" cycle, and particularly \"Rhialto the Marvellous\", are highly recommended.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Magic users are the only class capable of fabricating magic items that they cannot themselves employ. Clerics, druids and illusionists can fabricate magic items, but only those they themselves can use; items such as magical swords, that no primary spell casting class may use, are in their creation the sole province of magic users.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>At 11th level, a magic user may establish a stronghold (usually a tower or small keep) in the same manner as a fighter.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Minimum Scores: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Str 3, Dex 6, Int 9, Wis 6,Con 6, Cha 6</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Hit Die Type: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>d4 (max 11)</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Alignment: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Any</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Experience bonus: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Int 16+</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Armour/Shield Permitted: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>None</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Weapons Permitted: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Dagger, dart, oil, staff</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Weapon Proficiencies: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>1 + 1 per 5 levels</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Penalty to hit for non-proficiency: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>-5</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Weapon Specialisation: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>N/A</p>\n\t\t\t\t<h1>Magic User Class Abilities</h1>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Spellcasting: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Magic users may memorise and cast arcane spells in accordance with the tables provided below.

To accomplish the transfer of souls, the magic user must trap his or her own life essence within the jar prior to the transfer.

The range also limits the distance at which the magic user's soul may later escape from the jar and into another body.

He or she does not gain any knowledge from the creature's mind, such as languages known or the location of a lair, for the mind is trapped in the magic jar.

His \"Three Hearts and Three Lions\" is particularly highly recommended.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<u>Paladins suffer the following restrictions:0</u>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>First, the paladin may never possess more than ten magic items, and no more than a single suit of magic armour with no more than one magic shield may be so owned.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Second, the paladin must always give away a tenth of any money which he or she receives to some Lawful Good cause, and if he or she has any money remaining after paying his or her costs (such as maintaining equipment and paying servants' wages) this surplus must be likewise donated.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Third, paladins will not associate with characters who are not Good in alignment save under very exceptional circumstances (i.e., if approved by the GM).</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Minimum Scores: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Str 12, Dex 6, Con 9, Int 9, Wis 13, Cha 17</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Hit Die Type: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>d10 (max 9)</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Alignment: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Lawful Good only</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Experience bonus: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Str and Wis 16+</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Armour/Shield Permitted: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Any</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Weapons Permitted: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Any</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Weapon Proficiencies: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>3 + 1 every 2</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Penalty to hit for non-proficiency: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>-2</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Weapon Specialisation: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Optional rule - as fighter</p>\n\t\t\t\t<h1>Paladin Class Abilities</h1>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Improved Saving Throws: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>The paladin uses a more favourable saving throw table than other classes (see table, below).</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Cure Disease: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Paladins can cure disease (as the clerical spell) by touch, once per week.

Once the spell is cast, if the scroll is read aloud by the caster in the fiend's presence it will have the effects described below.

Fighters are trained in the use of weapons and armour, usually beginning their adventuring careers after a stint of training as a town guardsman, soldier, man at arms, bandit, pirate, or mercenary.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Fighters are the backbone of an adventuring party; without them to hold the line, the other members of the party will be overrun before they can bring their own skills to bear. Fighters are the most powerful characters in melee or missile combat, whether on offence or defence. Together with the ranger and paladin, they have the most hit points, and their ability to survive the most brutal battles is therefore unrivalled.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>They also have the best chance \"to hit\" of all the classes, particularly at higher level. They may use any kind of armour, shield, or weapon. Most fighters look forward to the day when their reputations will bring them into the ranks of the lesser nobility, where fighting prowess and armed followers are more important than high-flown bloodlines. It is no small matter to carve a freehold out of the wilderness, but to do so is to leave behind a legacy in a world where most fortune-seekers die an unsung death.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>A fighter of 9th level or higher who has built a castle and cleared a wide area around it of monsters (at least a 20 mile radius), will attract a body of mercenaries to his or her service, provided that these are paid a fair wage. He or she will also be able to tax each freeholder, at up to the maximum rate of 1 gp per month per resident. Some players may choose to retire a character at this point, satisfied that the character has entered the historical records and legends of the campaign world. Others may choose to view the stronghold merely as the first step toward the pinnacles of mythic power. Such player-held castles and villages provide a higher-level party with a base for adventures, a stronghold against enemies, and possibly the introduction of feudal politics and war into their already-eventful lives.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Minimum Scores: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Str 9, Dex 6, Con 7, Int 3, Wis 6, Cha 6</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Hit Die Type: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>d10 (max 9 hit dice)</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Alignment: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Any</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Experience bonus: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Strength 16+</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Armour/Shield Permitted: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Any</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Weapons Permitted: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Any</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Weapon Proficiencies: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>4 + 1 every 2 levels</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Penalty to hit for non-proficiency: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>-2</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Weapon Specialisation: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Optional</p>\n\t\t\t\t<h1>Fighter Class Abilities</h1>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Bonus Attacks: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Fighters with melee weapons attack once per round at 1st to 6th levels (1/1 attacks); at 7th to 12th levels, they attack thrice every two rounds (3/2 attacks); and at 13th or higher levels they attack twice per round (2/1 attacks). A partial additional attack (e.g. 3/2 attacks) means that the extra attack is taken on odd-numbered rounds in the combat sequence, hence two attacks on the first round, one on the second, two on the third and one on the fourth, if applicable.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Fighting the Unskilled: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>When the fighter is attacking creatures with less than a full hit die (i.e. less than [[/roll 1d8]] hit points), the fighter receives one attack for each of his or her levels of experience, e.g. a 4th-level fighter attacking goblins would receive 4 attacks per round.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>NB: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>A fighter exercising multiple attacks departs from the normal initiative procedure. The fighter will automatically attack first in the round unless fighting an opponent with multiple attacks of its own (in which case initiative should be rolled as normal). The fighter's second attack in any given melee round will come last in the sequence.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Weapon Specialisation (optional): </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>With the permission of the GM, weapon specialisation may be selected during character generation. If weapon specialisation is not selected during character generation, it remains forever unavailable to the character, barring some magical or divine intervention. If weapon specialisation is in play, fighters may take a second proficiency in the same weapon as the first, granting them one extra attack every 2 rounds with the weapon (hence 3/2 attacks with a melee weapon at 1st level, 2/1 at 7th and 5/2 at 13th), +1 to hit and +2 damage owing to their skill. Specialisation costs one proficiency \"slot\" for melee weapons and crossbows, and two \"slots\" for missile weapons other than crossbows</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Double Specialisation (optional): </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>For melee weapons that are not polearms or two-handed swords, a third weapon proficiency may be used to specialise further; this increases combat bonuses to +3 to hit and +3 damage with the weapon.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Optional Rule: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Where a fighter of extremely high level or with many bonuses \"to hit\" actually requires a negative score to hit his or her target, then at the GM's option, the negative score may be converted to a positive and applied as additional damage to the automatic hit. Thus, for example, a 20th level fighter with 19 strength and a +5 sword attacking an AC 2 dragon would require a roll of -8 to hit it; the character would be allowed to modify his or her damage roll by +8.</p>\n\t\t\t","dmonlytext":"","itemList":[{"name":"Fighter:Bonus Attacks at level
