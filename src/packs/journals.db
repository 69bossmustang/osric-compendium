{"_id":"1F6WkB7Wizi7Q0ZI","name":"Alignment","content":"<h1>Alignment</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Alignment represents where a character falls in terms of the ever-present battle between good and evil. Along the law-chaos axis, it also represents how the character approaches such issues. Alignment is more than a philosophy; evil and good are palpably real in the game world. An evil person bears the poison of his or her alignment in his or her very soul, and magic spells can even be used to detect the stain of it. In general, the good alignments will work together, although there may well be misunderstandings and disputes between those of differing good alignments. Relationships between those of evil alignments will generally be based on power and fear, although many evil aligned individuals or monsters are natural followers, not seeking to usurp power as much as they will seek to ally themselves with and serve the most powerful. The moral dictates of alignment are not tied to culture in any way; they are objective reality. If a barbarian comes from a society that kills the weak, he or she is evil if he or she accedes to the practice, even though it is considered necessary or beneficial in that culture. Such a culture is evil.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Each alignment has an \"alignment language\" specific to that alignment, allowing characters of that alignment to communicate with one another to a certain degree. Alignment tongues are not precisely languages; they cannot be rendered into writing, but they can be an effective mode of communication nonetheless, consisting of a variety of words, gestures, and even facial expressions. Alignment tongues are almost never used unless the speaker is certain he or she will be heard only by members of the same alignment.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Note that not all creatures of a particular alignment will speak their alignment tongue, although Demi-humans and humanoids will normally do so. A creature such as a chimæra, for example, that is non-humanoid and generally evil by nature rather than by choice, might be chaotic evil in alignment but would not speak the chaotic evil alignment tongue. A gnoll, however, that is humanoid and evil by choice as well as by nature, will tend to speak the chaotic evil alignment tongue.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><h1>The Nine Alignments</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Nine distinct alignments define all the possible combinations of the law-chaos axis with the good-evil axis. Remember that individuals vary from this norm, and that a given character may act more or less in accord with his or her alignment from day to day. Use these descriptions as guidelines, not as scripts.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Lawful Good, \"Crusader\": </b>A lawful good character acts as a good person is expected or required to act. He or she combines a commitment to oppose evil with the discipline to fight relentlessly. He or she normally tells the truth, keeps his or her word, helps those in need, and speaks out against injustice. A lawful good character hates to see the guilty go unpunished. Generally, lawful good characters seek to combine the values of both honour and compassion.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Neutral Good, \"Benefactor\": </b>A neutral good character does the best that a good person can do. He or she is devoted to helping others. He or she might work with or on behalf of kings and magistrates, but does not feel beholden to them if he or she feels that they are not serving the cause of good. Neutral good characters value doing what is good without a particular bias for or against order (or laws).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Chaotic Good, \"Rebel\": </b>A chaotic good character acts as his or her conscience directs, with little regard for what others might expect. He or she makes his or her own way, but is generally kind and benevolent. He or she believes in goodness and personal honour, but has little use for laws and regulations.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Such a character disdains those who seek to intimidate others and tell them what to do. He or she follows his or her own moral compass, which, although good, may not agree with that of society. Chaotic good characters value the combination of a good heart with a free spirit.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Lawful Neutral, \"Judge\": </b>A lawful neutral character acts as law, tradition, or a personal code directs him. Order and organisation are paramount. He or she may believe in personal order and live by a code or standard, or might believe in order for all, favouring a strong, organised government. Lawful neutral characters value reliability and honour, and some can be quite zealous about forcing these attributes onto society or other individuals.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Neutral: </b>A neutral character has no allegiance to either good vs evil or law vs chaos. Most neutral characters exhibit a lack of conviction or bias rather than a commitment to neutrality. These normally think of good as preferable to evil - after all, they would rather have good neighbours and rulers than evil ones.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Still, such characters are not personally committed to upholding good in any abstract or universal way, especially when there is treasure to be had. Some neutral characters, on the other hand, are morally committed to neutrality. They see good, evil, law, and chaos as prejudices and dangerous extremes, advocating and supporting neutrality as the best, most balanced road in the long run.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Chaotic Neutral, \"Free Spirit\": </b>A chaotic neutral character follows his or her whims. He or she is an individualist first and last. He or she values his or her own liberty but does not strive to protect others' freedom. He or she avoids authority, resents restrictions, and challenges traditions.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A chaotic neutral character does not normally intentionally disrupt organisations as part of a campaign of anarchy. To do so, he or she would have to be motivated either by good (and a desire to liberate others) or evil (and a desire to make those different from him- or herself suffer). A chaotic neutral character may be unpredictable, but his or her behaviour is not normally totally random.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Lawful Evil, \"Dominator\": </b>A lawful evil villain methodically takes what he or she wants within the limits of his or her code of conduct without regard for whom it hurts. He or she cares about tradition, loyalty, and order but not about freedom, dignity, or life. He or she plays by the rules but without mercy or compassion. He or she is comfortable in a hierarchy and would like to rule, but is willing to serve. He or she condemns others not according to their actions but according to race, religion, homeland, or social rank. He or she is loath to break laws or promises.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>This reluctance comes partly from his or her nature and partly because he or she depends on order to protect him- or herself from those who oppose him or her on moral grounds. Some lawful evil characters have particular taboos, such as not killing in cold blood (but having underlings do it) or not letting children come to harm (if it can be helped). They imagine that these compunctions put them above unprincipled villains. Some lawful evil people and creatures commit themselves to evil with a zeal like that of a crusader committed to good.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Beyond being willing to hurt others for their own ends, they take pleasure in spreading evil as an end unto itself. They may also see doing evil as part of a duty to an evil deity or master. Lawful evil is sometimes called \"diabolical,\" because devils are the epitome of lawful evil.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Neutral Evil, \"Malefactor\": </b>A neutral evil villain does whatever he or she can get away with. He or she is out for him- or herself, pure and simple. He or she sheds no tears for those he or she kills, whether for profit, sport, or convenience. He or she has no love of order and holds no illusion that following laws, traditions, or codes would make him or her any better or more noble. On the other hand, he or she doesn't have the restless nature or love of conflict that a chaotic evil villain has. Some neutral evil villains hold up evil as an ideal, committing evil for its own sake. Most often, such villains are devoted to evil deities or secret societies.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Chaotic Evil, \"Destroyer\": </b>A chaotic evil character does whatever his or her greed, hatred, and lust for destruction drive him to do. He or she is hot-tempered, vicious, arbitrarily violent, and unpredictable. If he or she is simply out for whatever he or she can get, he or she is ruthless and brutal. If he or she is committed to the spread of evil and chaos, he or she is even worse. His or her plans may be worked out well in advance, but their implementation will often be haphazard, and any group he or she forms is likely to be poorly organised.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Typically, chaotic evil creatures can be made to work together only by force, and their leader lasts only as long as he or she can thwart attempts to topple or assassinate him or her. Chaotic evil is sometimes called \"demonic\" because demons are the epitome of chaotic evil. Chaotic evil represents the destruction not only of beauty and life but also of the order on which beauty and life depend.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"modules/osric-compendium/images/000.0011alignment.jpg\" height=\"600\" />","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"I0IQ9ef7ZhLd66iw":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"91eab246b2cf2231c9ba1fdb19a1145f351febfc","sourceId":"JournalEntry.1F6WkB7Wizi7Q0ZI","defaultPermission":2},"cf":{"id":"temp_mxqg5406ji","path":"OSRIC-PC#/CF_SEP/Chapter 1: Creating a Character#/CF_SEP/Character Classes and Alignment","color":"#000000"}}}

{"_id":"1qJ1lDmLOveqI42s","name":"Adventures in Town","content":"<h1>Adventures in Town</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Most activities that characters perform \"in town\", such as gathering information, hiring men-at-arms or guides, purchasing equipment, liquidating treasure, resting and healing, hiring NPC spell casters to identify unknown magic items or remove afflictions, training to gain new levels, etc. can be handled abstractly. It occurs \"offstage\" - the players make notes in their records (adding or subtracting the corresponding amounts of gold), the GM notes the number of days that have passed, and the game resumes when the players are next ready to venture into the dungeons or wilderness.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Sometimes the group will wish to play out one or more of these in-town activities rather than relegating them to an offstage between-session limbo. This could be as simple as a few minutes' pre-expedition interviewing potential hirelings, or post-adventure cajoling a local wizard to transform an unfortunate companion back into a human for a reasonable rate, or as complex as a whole session spent gathering intelligence for a major expedition. Some adventures can take place in-town with only brief dungeon or wilderness interludes, such as a murder-mystery or an adventure focusing on diplomatic negotiations or political skullduggery.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Even when these sorts of activities are played out, they still tend to be conducted in a more abstract and free-form manner than a dungeon or wilderness adventure. For instance, in town-based adventures the players rarely if ever draw a map, record-keeping of supplies such as torches or rations is rarely an issue, and a strict marching order may not be necessary or even applicable. Even the notion of keeping the party together often falls by the wayside as one character buys equipment while another gathers rumours from travellers at the inn, and a third visits the local temple. When a less-abstract reckoning is required, such as when the party is venturing into a dangerous Thieves' Quarter and are in danger of being ambushed and mugged, then the norms and standards of a dungeon exploration will generally apply - time measured in turns, movement in tens of feet (typically at the \"travelling\" rate of 5× normal, if the party is not mapping or expecting traps), \"wandering monster\" checks every 3rd turn (though in town such an encounter is usually with a beggar, urchin, pick-pocket, member of the town watch, or one of Gary Gygax's infamous Wandering Prostitutes).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"modules/osric-compendium/images/000.003 how2play4.jpg\" height=\"600\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Because adventures in town tend to be so much more free-form than dungeon or wilderness exploration, they can be harder for the GM to run. There is no convenient flowchart of steps, making it easier to overlook things. Also, because town adventures tend to focus more on negotiation and in- character conversation between players and NPCs, the focus is more one-on-one of player to GM. Other players whose characters are not involved in a particular scene can be left sitting around observing and waiting for their \"turn\" which can lead to player boredom and frustration. For both of these reasons, town adventures are only recommended for experienced GMs, for small groups of players, and for those who particularly enjoy the in-character \"play-acting\" aspect of the game. Be wary of bored players who might have their characters pick random fights in town just to have something to do, and realise, if this does happen, that the blame can lie as much or more with the GM than with the player.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"I0IQ9ef7ZhLd66iw":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"3198a64f592c0cf54f0f4916e36d6096744f45c5","sourceId":"JournalEntry.1qJ1lDmLOveqI42s","defaultPermission":2},"cf":{"id":"temp_slzxs9y0tvj","path":"OSRIC-PC#/CF_SEP/Chapter 3: How to Play#/CF_SEP/Adventure and Exploration","color":"#000000"}}}

These monsters are grey-green in colour, standing around 8 ft-12 ft tall, with a hide that mimics the smooth limestone formations of a natural cavern.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Ropers are about 3 ft-4 ft at the base and approximately 1 ft wide at the apex. These monsters are almost always encountered in their stalagmite shape but can alter their appearance to some degree. A roper can assume the shape of a pillar, a boulder, or flatten themselves and lie flat to appear as no more than an irregularity on the walking surface of the cavern floor. It can also cling to a cavern ceiling (or wall) and appear as a stalactite. Through means of tiny adhesive cilia on its underside, the roper can move slowly and these cilia are what allow it to cling upside down to the ceiling. <b>Ropers are predators and attack by means of the 6 rope-like appendages that give these monsters their name. The ropes secrete a powerful and poisonous adhesive and can lash out some distance from the creature; up to 50 ft. A successful to hit roll will weaken the target, decreasing its strength ability score by 50% (rounded down) within [[/roll 1d3]] rounds and lasting [[/roll 2d4]] turns; with multiple hits having a cumulative strength drain effect. </b><u>An ensnared victim can break the strand by performing a Minor Test of Strength </u>but for every round the victim is roped he or she will be dragged 10 ft closer to the roper. <b>Creatures within 10 ft of the roper are subject to it vicious bite attack, this attack automatically hits any victim held by the strands of the roper. </b><u>A strand can be sliced with an edged weapon but the attack must do a minimum of 6 points of damage in a single attack to the AC 0 tentacle to sever it. </u>The strand of a roper can easily pull 800 lbs and can lift about a third of that amount.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A roper is a tough monster. <u>The stony hide grants it AC 0 in combat and it has an innate resistance to magic. Besides its base 80% magic resistance, the roper is completely immune to electricity based damage including lightning, ropers are also resistant to cold based magic and take only half damage from any such attacks. These creatures have few weaknesses but are susceptible to fire, saving vs fire based attacks at -4. </u>Any fire based magic attacks, however, <u>must still overcome the monster's magic resistance.</u></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Ropers do not hoard treasure but their acidic bile cannot dissolve platinum or gemstones. Cutting open the gizzard of a roper has a 40% chance of yielding [[/roll 3d6]] (3-18) platinum pieces and 30% chance of [[/roll 4d6]] (4-24) gems.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Quartz Roper:</u>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>To adventurers familiar with ropers, a quartz roper appears as a 5-ft tall and 2-ft wide (at the base) statue of a roper hewn from some brownish or smoky grey crystalline mineral. The quartz roper is actually a monster with a rocky hide composed of living quartz. Quartz ropers are very sensitive to motion and are able to sense movement up to 225-ft away.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>In combat, quartz ropers fight in a manner similar to ropers (q.v.): <b>its tentacles can hit targets up to 50-ft away, the poisonous adhesive of the tentacles inflicts a 50% strength penalty on its targets, and it drags roped victims toward itself to deliver its nasty bite automatically.</b></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A quartz roper also differs from its larger cousins in a number of ways. First, <b>it tends to concentrate its first attacks on two victims, striking each with 3 tentacles. The first two successfully roped victims will be injected with a venom </b><u>which allows no saving throw </u>and causes the victim to freeze in place, looking as if he or she has been turned to stone. <b>One round after this apparent stoning the victim recovers but is now under the delusion the quartz roper is a close friend and valued ally. </b>These influenced adventurers will fight to protect the monster to the utmost of their abilities <b>for the duration of effect of the venom; 10 turns. </b>If the quartz roper is killed before the venom expires, <b>the deluded defenders will cease attacking and wander about aimlessly until the venom expires. </b><u>The quartz roper can only inject its venom twice per day and afterward its combat tactics conform to those of a roper. </u>A quartz roper's tentacles are strong, but not so strong as the larger variety of roper. <u>A roped character's chances of breaking free are equal to double his or her chance to perform a Minor Test of Strength.</u></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Quartz ropers also lack a roper's magic resistance but <u>its mineral-laden hide will resist normal missile fire, </u>though magic missiles and hand held weapons damage it normally. All magic spells do normal damage as well. A quartz roper's gizzard has the same percentage chance of containing platinum pieces and gemstones as the standard variety of roper.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"I0IQ9ef7ZhLd66iw":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"faa7e80596040be4d9554aebbfaa387f2143a15a","sourceId":"JournalEntry.2Mor6VldZaPDmHdp"},"cf":{"id":"temp_7sa1hbclizd","path":"OSRIC-GM#/CF_SEP/Chapter 5: Monsters#/CF_SEP/Other Creatures","color":"#000000"}}}

{"_id":"3K0phasJ2FlxFvPT","name":"Aerial Agility","content":"<h1>Aerial Agility</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>This section of the rules outlines the basics of aerial movement to assist the GM with flying monsters and movement on flying mounts or otherwise in the air. Flying creatures gain altitude at half their movement rate and dive at a 45° angle, descending 1-ft for every 1-ft of forward movement. Creatures with aerial agility level VI are not subject to these two restrictions (see below). Diving attacks over 30-ft grant a double damage bonus vs non-diving targets, including ground targets. Attacking while climbing incurs no damage or attack penalty. The GM may wish to consider an operational flying ceiling of 5,000-ft above sea level, the upper limit of breathable air without special means on Earth, though a campaign world might be quite different.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Apart from aerial agility level I, the lower level classification of fliers are generally larger, more massive creatures. Lighter and smaller creatures tend to be classed in the higher levels.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Except for very large creatures, such as dragons, riding a flying monster reduces its aerial agility by one step.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The levels enumerated below represent stops along a spectrum of ability, so the GM may assume a small amount of variance within each level. Turning capacity assumes full movement rate; creatures moving at half-speed turn as one class higher. Level II, III, and IV creatures must be moving at least half-speed to remain airborne.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Level I: </b>Barely a flying creature, these creatures float on the air, allowing the wind currents to carry them from location to location. These creatures can sometimes slightly alter their direction of travel or move at very slow speeds, but otherwise manoeuvre like a hot air balloon (e.g. levitate spell). This category also includes gliding creatures, such as flying squirrels or flying fish, that travel through the air but do not truly fly.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Level II: </b>Creature requires 5 rounds to reach full aerial movement rate and can turn 30° per round (e.g. dragon).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Level III: </b>Creature can reach full aerial movement rate in 2 rounds and can turn 60° in one round (e.g. sphinx).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Level IV: </b>Average agility. Flying creatures of this type reach full airspeed in 1 round and can turn 90° per round (e.g. flying carpet, giant bat).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Level V: </b>Full airspeed is reached in 6 segments and the flier can turn 120° per round. These creatures can also come to a complete stop in 6 segments and are capable of hovering in place (e.g. fly spell, mephit).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Level VI: </b>These are creatures born to fly, taking to the air as naturally as a human walks on the ground. Such fliers can reach full speed or complete stop in 1 segment, and can hover. Level VI fliers can easily reverse course in flight, gracefully executing turns of 180°.

This is deliberate - the planes are intentionally left blank as a possible route for future creativity. They are for higher-level play (for characters of at least 10th level), when play in the normal game world should be growing too easy. The OSRIC core rules game balance begins to break down at higher levels than this, though enjoyable adventuring in carefully-designed environments may still be possible.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>At this stage, suffice it to say that:</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The normal campaign world is situated on the Prime Material Plane, wherein things and creatures are generally made of matter (hence \"material\"). There are two planes immediately contiguous with the Prime Material Plane: the astral and æthereal planes.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>These planes are misty, vaporous places. It is possible dimly to perceive the Prime Material Plane from the astral or the æthereal, but only as shadowy and indistinct shapes and forms. A creature the size of a human is only visible within about 30-ft of the viewer. While certain magical creatures can perceive the astral or æthereal planes or even attack within them, apart from this a character on an alternative plane is completely imperceptible: not just invisible, but silent and similarly concealed from all senses.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A character can use the astral or æthereal planes to pass through solids such as walls on the Prime Material. Such things are not solid at all on these planes. If the character is \"inside\" a solid object via this route, visibility is zero; the character is effectively blind. He or she must emerge into some open area, or return to the Prime Material will be fatal, no saving throw.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>When a player character enters a new plane, he or she makes a \"bloink\", like the splash when someone jumps into water. Powerful hostile creatures on the planes can detect the \"bloink\" and will move to intercept. A character below 10th level may remain on another plane for up to [[/roll 1d6]] turns. Beyond that, assume he or she is consumed by the astral/æthereal equivalent of a grue. In other words, that character is gone, permanently and irrevocably destroyed without any possibility of raising or resurrection short of a wish.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Certain other planes (the elemental planes, the abyss, the hells, the negative material plane, and so on) are mentioned from time to time. These references are deliberately left obscure.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>In the planes, things are different. The core rules will not necessarily apply. Magic items and spells may not function as they would elsewhere. \"To hit\" and damage rolls may vary, as may class abilities, saving throws or indeed anything else at all.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>When a character above 10th level desires to explore the planes, as will eventually happen in a long-running campaign, the GM will need to determine what happens there.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>By that stage, the authors hope, the GM will be sufficiently experienced to cope with the situation and indeed enjoy rising to the challenge.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The authors would like, in the fullness of time, to release an optional supplement or supplements about the planes, but this will not form part of the OSRIC core rules.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"I0IQ9ef7ZhLd66iw":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"7ead2c2dedbc0ac20d2423a0d82e756f75aeaca8","sourceId":"JournalEntry.4ZFpwobonQQAgpZz","defaultPermission":2},"cf":{"id":"temp_slzxs9y0tvj","path":"OSRIC-PC#/CF_SEP/Chapter 3: How to Play#/CF_SEP/Adventure and Exploration","color":"#000000"}}}

{"_id":"645HqNdP8AEzcu6i","name":"Adapter's Notes for Fantasy Grounds","content":"<p>This module builds on and fleshes out other OSRIC adaption work for Fantasy Grounds (FG) originally completed by Sterno and Alterzwerg for the FG 2E ruleset; thank you, gentlemen, for your foundational efforts.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Unlike the referenced works, this module is optimized for use with Celestian's 1E extension to the 2E ruleset; so as to use OSRIC in the closest available FG environment to its inherent structure. It will also work fine without use of the 1E extension, so long as the user is aware of certain changes which substitute OSRIC data in categories where OSRIC and 2E conflict (e.g., all monsters/NPCs default surprise value is lowered to \"2\" from the previous \"3\"; weapon speed values are removed to simple text in the properties line and no longer modify initiative rolls (although high dex for ranged weapons, or other OSRIC initiative modifers, may be placed in that field which will then modify initiative for that action - see notes on initiative below), there is no initiative modifier for size, or casting time modifier for at-will spell abilities, etc., etc., etc.).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>IMPORTANT: many of OSRIC's ambiguities and omissions are purposeful, so as to sustain long-standing GM interpretations of previous imprecise language and also to avoid possible non-compliance with the OGL or general copyright law in some few areas. If you're aware of some specific variance or additional information in other generally similar rule books, and want that reflected in your copy of the FG OSRIC mod, drag-copy entries (so that FG Forge updates don't override the entry back to \"factory settings\") and make your own modifications to the copied entry, using it in play instead. <i>For example, </i>in my personal campaign I modify the assassination skill values and give ghast stench penalties a duration.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Notable (but non-exhaustive) changes and additions</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>The largest change is the inclusion of the text as a reference, along with creation of many tables and modifiers found therein.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>You can use group initiative for speed and combat flow; anyone that has an initiative modifier based on their action should roll individual initiative instead, which will override the group initiative result for that character only. Common actions having initiative modifiers include (but are not limited to) casting spells, using certain magic items, and ranged attacks by high-dex characters. Look at the yellow initiative box associated with that action. If the number inside is <b><u>not </u></b>\"0\" then anyone taking that action should roll individual initiative. This still, in practice, means the group initiative die roll result will be used by nearly everyone most of the time if the GM chooses to use group initiative generally.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Dexterity modifiers to initiative for ranged attacks must be added to the ranged weapon's Weapon Speed field as discussed above. This is accomplished by clicking the black gear in the \"Weapons\" tab for that item and inputting the bonus/penalty into the weapon speed field there. In OSRIC weapon speed doesn't routinely modify initiative so the box normally defaults to \"0\". Example: a character with a long bow has a dex of 17, so the player inputs \"-2\" in the weapon speed field for his longbow item. The yellow \"initiative\" box for the long bow attack would now show as \"-2\" on that character's <i>Actions </i>tab, and rolling invidual initiative by clicking this box when shooting their bow will apply the modifier. [ <b><i>FG Note: </i></b><i>book-OSRIC's initiative system is \"roll high\"; FG's built-in system is \"roll low\". So what shows in OSRIC as a \"+2\" modifier becomes a \"-2\" in FG (or vice-versa for penlties) - the point is the modifier is beneficial (or detrimental) to the character </i>]</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>As mentioned above, surprise values are updated to OSRIC's default value of 2 or less; weapon speeds are removed from items except as data in the property field, and no longer adjust initiative roll results</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Dwarf/Gnome Abilities: These detection abilities are added as skills; players will need to drag them on to their character sheets.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Auto-updating skills: Assassins' and thieves' various skills now automatically increase upon a new level; however, this wipes out modifications previously entered for race and/or dexterity (which will require re-entry). However, on balance, this lessens effort by a greater degree than it increases it as not all characters will have these bonuses.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Unarmed combat attacks of pummeling, grappling, and overbearing are given as weapon-items. These should be dragged to the characters inventory just as when taking dagger, mace or sword as weapons for that character. However, they populate on the powers tab instead of the attacks tab, as some of them have follow on special effects such as \"restrained\" or \"prone\". Go to the powers tab to use the unarmed attack forms and roll from there.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>MU and Clerical \"Spheres\": Spells for clerics and MUs are now also given \"spheres\": clerical and MU, respectively. This is a mechanical/database convenience, only, so as to make it possible to bring up only their spell lists without admixture of druids' or illusionists' spells. In OSRIC proper there are no spheres.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Item Saves: For those GMs desiring incorporation of item saving throws, the roll-under skill function is experimentally repurposed as item saves. The saves are inverted (a roll-over save value of \"13\" is changed to a roll-under \"8\"), and a player may drag item save categories a GM wishes to make expeditiously available to their character sheet as \"nonweapon/skills\" - they have no functionality unless dragged on to a character sheet. This allows the quick function of clicking through the list if item destruction is possible, at the admitted expense of a possibly lengthy list in the character sheet itself. However, not all the save categories must be used (this GM ignores any where the math makes a given result nearly inevitable).</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Morale values are updated to percentile scores</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>XP values are given for all entries - no more \"variable\" entries that mean you have to figure it out using tables! NOTE: XP values provided for variant monsters and classed NPCs are my own calculations using my judgement to interpret the OSRIC XP determination tables. You may feel they are too high (or too low). Don't hesitate to replace them if you prefer.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>the \"ammo\" category is used for items such as arrows and bullets; \"weapon\" is reserved for persistent items.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>How GMs handle magic armour weight varies considerably; in these modules magic armour weight and base move isn't modified from the non-magical version's. Each GM can choose whether to reduce weight of a magic armour item by half (or entirely), give a magical suit of plate mail a move rate of 12 or 9, etc.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>In OSRIC, attacks that multiply damage: backstab, certain swords against giants and dragons, etc., multiply only the base damage rolled by the weapon and not strength or magic bonuses. Existing automation available multiples all of these bonuses together with the base damage roll, and so isn't used. Manual modifications of the damage must be made by reapplying the bonus after reviewing the base damage rolled in the chat window.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Many OSRIC magic items are usable \"1/week\", or some other value not otherwise available in FG. In these cases they will show \"X\"/day to establish they are not \"use at-will\" items, with the true intermittency listed in the text.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>The Inclusion of Spell (and Item) NPCs</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The employment of many spells or items result in combat entities that aren't existing monsters, and are largely independent of the caster; an example is a phantasmal killer. Certain \"Spell/Item NPCs\" are added to the set for convenience in accounting for these entities on the field of battle. In general, an NPC was created if:</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>1. The effect is not enhancing a caster ability</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>2. It isn't replicating an existing monster</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>3. It operates independently of the caster</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>4. it has different characteristics - for example, the phantasmal killer always attacks as a 4HD monster, which may vary from the attack rating of the caster.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"I0IQ9ef7ZhLd66iw":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"2535103b1f82731c3ce9e12a04d49b01e8d9f4f6","sourceId":"JournalEntry.645HqNdP8AEzcu6i","defaultPermission":2},"cf":{"id":"temp_dzpz1ge5so","path":"OSRIC-PC#/CF_SEP/OSRIC#/CF_SEP/Adapter's Notes for Fantasy Grounds","color":"#000000"}}}

Indeed, a familiar can also be of considerable benefit to a lower level magic user (even increasing others' estimation of his or her power), but the risks inherent in losing a familiar can be daunting to a weaker spell caster. To summon a familiar, the magic user must intone the words of the spell over a stocked fire source, sprinkling the flames with expensive incense and powders (100 gp in total value). The caster must maintain his or her casting for as long as necessary ([[/roll 2d12]] hours) until a familiar arrives (or the casting time expires without success). <b>The spell may be attempted only once per year, and the caster has no control over the type of animal that will respond.

{"_id":"8fRTiLAe9o7lbiRU","name":"Monster Statistics","content":"<h1>Monster Statistics</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Each of the monsters in this book has a number of listed characteristics. The meaning of each characteristic is as follows:</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Frequency: </b>The monster's relative rarity in a typical game world can fall into five categories. A unique monster is the only one in existence. Very rare monsters are seldom en- countered, and when seen it is a matter of great interest to naturalists and sages. A rare monster is one usually known to the average peasant, but only in rumour and folklore. Uncommon creatures are known to the common folk but are infrequently seen. Common creatures are familiar, and when they are seen, it may be cause for alarm but not surprise.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>No. Encountered: </b>This is only a guideline for the GM and should vary according to the circumstances. It is quite possible to encounter a lone orc, for example.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Size: </b>Three categories are possible here, being Small (i.e. of less weight or mass than a normal human), Medium or Man-sized (i.e. weighing roughly the same as a human), and Large (generally bigger than a human).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Move: </b>Movement is expressed in feet per turn or round (see Chapter 3). Flying creatures' aerial agility level (see Chapter 3) is indicated thus: \"AA:level\" in parentheses.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Armour Class: </b>Armour class (AC) is as described in Chapter 1. The AC value for a creature does not necessarily mean it is wearing the equivalent armour type, so an AC 5 creature may not necessarily be wearing chain mail, even if it is generally similar to a human.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Hit Dice: </b>The number of hit points for a creature is determined by rolling dice. Usually hit dice (HD) are [[/roll 1d8]]s unless otherwise specified. Some creatures have hit points in the format \"X+Y\" or \"X-Y\", in which case \"X\" refers to the number of dice rolled and \"Y\" refers to a numerical adjustment applied to the total (note in the case of \"X-Y\" the resulting hit points cannot be less than 1). Thus, a creature with HD 4+1 has [[/roll 4d8+1]] hp, for a total numerical range of 5-33.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Attacks: </b>This entry refers to the number of attacks per round the creature normally possesses in melee. This number may be modified by certain spells such as haste or slow and does not include any special attack forms such as a breath weapon. Note the distinction between \"attacks\" and \"attack routines\" as described in Chapter 3 - many creatures have several attacks, but very few have several separate attack routines. In the rare cases where one does, this is described in the creature text.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Damage: </b>This entry indicates the number and type of dice to be rolled for damage if the creature's physical attacks hit. If the value provided is \"by weapon\" the GM should decide what weapon the monster is using and refer to Chapter 1. In some cases the damage inflicted may include a magical element, poison, or some other effect requiring a saving throw or other special ruling, but in this case the attack form will be listed as a \"special attack\" and detailed in the creature text.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Special Attacks: </b>This entry is a short note regarding any unusual attack forms the creature might possess. Unless the special attack are so simple as to be self-evident, these unusual attacks are fully explained in the creature text.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Special Defences: </b>This entry, like the entry for special attacks, is really just a signal to the GM that the monster has unusual or magical protections described in the creature text.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Magic Resistance: </b>This is the chance, expressed as a percentage, that the creature will be unaffected by any magic specifically targeted at it. Even if the chance fails, the creature may still receive a saving throw if the spell or magical attack form normally calls for one. This percentage is predicated on a caster of 11th level of experience, and should be varied by 5% downwards or upwards per experience level of the caster above or below 11th respectively.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Lair Probability: </b>This is the chance that the creature will be encountered in its lair. Creatures not met in their lair are termed \"wandering\". Generally, most creatures will keep some or most of their treasure in their lair, so if the monster is wandering, the players will normally need to find the lair to obtain its full treasure.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Intelligence: </b>This indicates the intelligence of the creature relative to the average human. Possible values include \"Non-\", \"Animal\", \"Semi-\", \"Low\", \"Average\", \"Very\", \"High\", \"Exceptional\", \"Genius\" or occasionally even higher. A non-intelligent creature has an effective intelligence of 0 and a genius has an effective intelligence of 18.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Alignment: </b>See the description of alignment in Chapter 1. The alignment shown for any given type of monster may not represent the alignment of an individual creature of that type. In the case of less intelligent monsters, there is usually little variation, but a few of the more intelligent ones might deviate from the prevailing alignment by a small amount. Thus it is possible to have a Neutral Evil goblin, or even a tribe of Neutral Evil goblins - but good aligned ones would be rare in the extreme.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>This does not impinge on the GM's right to make sweeping adjustments to creature alignments for the purposes of a specific campaign.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Level/XP Value: </b>This represents a pre-calculation of the creature's Experience Point (XP) value and level as determined in Chapter 3. Note that the Chapter 3 guidelines are exactly that - guidelines. In some cases the XP value has been adjusted to take account of special factors and could not be reached by the Chapter 3 method.

Information provided here applies to Prime Material Plane encounters only. Often referred to by the common folk as a firebird or bennu bird, sighting a phoenix is believed to be a good omen and a mark of divine favour. Though the phoenix is a creature of the Outer Planes, it finds great joy in scenes of tranquil beauty and is therefore most often encountered deep in sylvan woods, in the company of fey creatures and woodland animals. Though a phoenix is a formidable foe many of its body parts are prized by alchemists and wizards and as a result, a phoenix in the Prime Material Plane avoids contact with most living creatures besides the fey denizens of the deep woods. Even good aligned characters seeking its help will be viewed with a degree of mistrust, at least initially.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>In combat, the phoenix employs one of two attack routines; either two clawing attacks when airborne or one beak attack if not </b>. What makes the phoenix even more imposing in combat, however, are its myriad spell-like abilities and special powers.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Through the use of these abilities, it is difficult even to engage the creature in combat if it desires to avoid it.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Due to its other-planar nature, <u>the phoenix can only be hit with +3 or better weapons. </u>The creature can <b>constantly and automatically </b><b><i>detect charm </i></b>, <b><i>detect evil </i></b>, and <b><i>detect magic </i></b>; constantly radiates <b><i>protection from fear, 10 ft radius </i></b>, and <u>has a 50% magic resistance. </u>The phoenix can become astral or æthereal at will, and <b>once per week can transport itself and up to 10 man-sized creatures to its home plane </b>(it can also reach its home dimension through the use of its astral and æthereal ability). A phoenix has finely-honed senses and therefore <u>cannot be surprised. </u><b>It receives +3 to all initiative rolls. </b>The phoenix has <b>120 ft range in both infravision and low-light vision. </b>This amazing being can <b>heal itself or another creature spontaneously, up to 100 hit points total per day. </b>It can also cure disease with but a touch of its beak, <b>limited to one cure disease per creature per day. </b>It can also <b>cast cure light wounds </b>at will with a brush of its wingtips, <u>though any human or humanoid can only be healed thus twice during any one day </u>. <b>A phoenix has the innate ability to cause a tremendous heat up to thrice per day; igniting all flammable materials, boiling liquids, and blistering exposed skin </b>. <u>It can also dissipate any energy based attack, ranging from spells to dragon breath, up to thrice per day and taking no damage therefrom. </u><b>Its powerful voice can </b><b><i>dispel illusion </i></b><b>and </b><b><i>dispel magic </i></b><b>at a level equal to a 40th level magic user, and cast exorcise as a 40th level cleric.</b></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>In addition to all the above, the phoenix can use the following spell-like abilities at will, once per round </b>at a 20th level of ability, unless otherwise noted: <b><i>affect normal fires </i></b>, <b><i>audible glamour </i></b>, <b><i>blink </i></b>, <b><i>blindness </i></b>, <b><i>blur </i></b>, <b><i>control temperature 50' radius </i></b>, <b><i>continual light </i></b>, <b><i>find traps </i></b>, <b><i>fire charm </i></b>, <b><i>fire shield </i></b>, <b><i>improved invisibility </i></b>, <b><i>misdirection </i></b>, <b><i>produce flame </i></b>, <b><i>pyrotechnics </i></b>, <b><i>remove curse </i></b>, <b><i>remove fear 10' radius </i></b>, <b><i>snake charm </i></b>. <b>Once per day, the phoenix can use the following spell-like abilities </b>, again at 20th level: <b><i>call woodland beings </i></b>, <b><i>duo-dimension </i></b>, <b><i>find the path </i></b>, <b><i>fire quench </i></b>(reverse of the druid spell produce fire), <b><i>fire seeds </i></b>, <b><i>fire storm </i></b>, <b><i>neutralise poison </i></b>, <b><i>reincarnate </i></b>, <b><i>veil </i></b>, <b><i>wall of fire </i></b>. <b>Thrice per day the phoenix can cast </b><b><i>colour spray </i></b>, <b><i>heat metal </i></b>, <b><i>polymorph self </i></b>, and <b>once per week </b>can cast <b><i>incendiary cloud </i></b>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The phoenix has two final special abilities it will only use when great need is upon it. First, <b>it can fire up to 8 of its feathers at its opponents per round. These feathers will sap 5 hp apiece from the phoenix and explode as a holly berry </b><b><i>fireseed </i></b><b>. </b>If overcome in battle, the phoenix can release its version of a retributive strike--invoking a hellish firestorm of destruction <b>equal in power to a firestorm combined with an incendiary cloud, each cast at 40th level of ability. </b>This mega-firestorm can be created even if both spell abilities have already been used that day. <b>This attack will kill the phoenix (and most likely everything else within range) but leaves behind a crystalline egg the size of an adult human head </b>. A new phoenix will arise from the egg in [[/roll 3d8]] days.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Description: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</i>The phoenix is a large bird vaguely resembling a stork or heron, with beautiful plumage of bright gold and fiery red that catches the light in a manner reminiscent of dancing flames. Its dagger-sharp claws and long, hard beak are an iridescent violet; the eyes of a phoenix have been described as rubies glowing with an inner fire. The phoenix speaks the language of its kind; the language of any feathered, flying creature; and can communicate with other creatures with either telepathy or telempathy, as appropriate to the level of intelligence of the other creature.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"I0IQ9ef7ZhLd66iw":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"649db32479c580945a135c55e3e26f06de067929","sourceId":"JournalEntry.8lp3NdjdEif159VD"},"cf":{"id":"temp_7sa1hbclizd","path":"OSRIC-GM#/CF_SEP/Chapter 5: Monsters#/CF_SEP/Other Creatures","color":"#000000"}}}

{"_id":"9ZcFE2qzvasMgijh","name":"Assassin","content":"<h1>Assassin</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Assassins are stealthy killers, trained by their shadowy guilds in the arts of spying, disguise, poison, and murder. Although assassins of lower level are little more than trained thugs, the eminences of this reprehensible profession are so feared as to be spoken of only in whispers. High-level assassins are artists of murder, and their experience with hunting highly-placed targets, coupled with extensive education and training, often gives the sinister nobility of this class a silken, refined veneer over their true, murderous natures. This veneer, like many things pertaining to the assassins, is deceptive; survival in the higher echelons of an assassins' guild requires animal cunning and a complete absence of mercy. Assassin characters must begin with an evil alignment.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Virtually all cities (and many towns) will have a guild of assassins operating within the city walls and in the surrounding region, made up of 6-24 assassins of varying level. Player character assassins, if they are identified by the local guild, will be invited to join (such invitations ranging from polite to violent). Joining a guild places the assassin under the command of the local guildmaster, which may be inconvenient (and will require the assassin to pay a share of his take to the guild), but assassins' guilds take a very dim view of freelancers working in their territory. Freelance assassins - and their companions - do not ordinarily live to enjoy old age. There are, of course, benefits to joining such a guild; training costs may be reduced, and the guild may be a good source of information about potential missions or nearby enemies.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"modules/osric-compendium/images/000.001 assassin.jpg\" height=\"600\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Assassins' guilds are controlled by a guildmaster of 14th level - an assassin of lower level might take control, but would be unable to inspire the fear necessary to keep rival guilds from forming. To gain 14th level, an assassin character must take control of an assassins' guild by killing (directly or indirectly) the existing guildmaster. Whenever the control of an assassins' guild changes hands, most of the assassins will abandon the guild and depart the area, normally leaving the guild reduced to a quarter of its original membership.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The grandmaster of assassins (a campaign may have one or more) is a figure of legend and fear. These dark eminences usually live far from the cities, in remote and guarded locations - their fame is such that those who need their services will seek them out. To advance to 15th level, an assassin must find and kill one of the existing grandmasters.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>The Assassin Character</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Minimum Scores: Str 12, Dex 12, Con 6, Int 11, Wis 6</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Hit Die Type: [[/roll 1d6]] (max 15)</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Alignment: Any evil</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Experience bonus: None</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Armour/Shield Permitted: Leather or studded leather only (shields allowed)</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Weapons Permitted: Any</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Weapon Proficiencies: 3+1 every 4 levels</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Penalty \"to hit\" for non-proficiency: -3</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Weapon Specialisation: N/A</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Assassin Class Abilities</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Assassination: </b>If an assassin gains surprise (see \"Combat\") he or she may elect to assassinate the victim. The assassin need not roll \"to hit\" for an assassination attempt, which is a special attack resulting in a chance to kill the victim instantly and ensure damage even if the victim is not successfully killed. The percentage chance to kill a victim is 50%, with a bonus of 5% per level of the assassin and a penalty of 5% for every two levels of the target (rounding down; in the case of monsters, substitute \"hit dice\" for \"level\"). These numbers are approximate, for the GM should modify the assassin's chances slightly upward or downward according to the circumstances - guarded or wary targets are less likely to be killed, and unwary victims are more likely to die. If the assassination attempt does not succeed, the attack still inflicts normal damage, together with any applicable bonuses. The assassin does not gain backstab multiple damage on a failed assassination attempt, even if the assassination attempt was made from behind.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Backstab: </b>An assassin may backstab with any of the melee weapons permissible to the thief class. Backstabbing doubles the weapon's damage at levels 1-4, triple at levels 5-8, quadruple at level 9-12, and so on. Also, an assassin attacks from behind with a bonus \"to hit\" of +4 rather than the ordinary +2.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Disguise: </b>Assassins are masters of disguise. Within reasonable limits, an assassin can make him- or herself appear slightly shorter or considerably taller, fatter or thinner, or of the opposite gender. An assassin can even disguise him- or herself as a member of another race (again, within reason). Any person observing the disguised assassin has a base 2% chance to see through the disguise, with one chance per day to do so. The base chance of seeing through a disguise increases another 2% if the assassin is posing as another class, race or gender (max 8% chance). The GM may assign additional penalties and bonuses to this check if the observer is unusually wise or intelligent (or particularly stupid), and common sense, of course, applies at all times.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Poison: </b>Assassins are not inherently better at using poison than any other character class capable of using poison, but generally have more opportunities to gain knowledge of poisons and their effects.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Thief Abilities: </b>The assassin has thief abilities as a thief two levels below the assassin's level. At first level, the assassin has the thieving abilities of a first level thief, but does not gain the abilities of a second level thief until reaching fourth level.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Advanced Abilities</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>L <b>anguages (9th): </b>Ninth and higher-level assassins with Int 15+ may learn languages that it would be impossible for a non-assassin to learn. An assassin can learn an alignment tongue other than his or her own, druids' cant, and thieves' cant as additional languages, but can only learn a maximum of four such special languages, one for each point of intelligence above 14. Only one such language can be learned per level above eighth. Such languages are over and above any limits imposed by the assassin's race and intelligence.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Read Scrolls (12th): </b>When an assassin reaches 12th level, he or she has received sufficient training to cast spells from an arcane scroll (magic user or illusionist).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Assassin Level Advancement</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<table>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tbody><tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Level</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Base Experience Points Required</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Hit Dice (d6)</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Notes</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>0</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</td></tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>1,600</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</td></tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>3,000</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</td></tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>4</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>5,750</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>4</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>The assassin may recruit assassins as henchmen</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>5</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>12,250</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>5</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</td></tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>6</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>24,750</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>6</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</td></tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>7</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>50,000</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>7</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</td></tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>8</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>99,000</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>8</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>The assassin may recruit thieves as henchmen</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>9</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>200,500</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>9</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Master Assassin</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>10</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>300,000</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>10</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</td></tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>11</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>400,000</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>11</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</td></tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>12</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>600,000</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>12</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>The assassin may recruit henchmen of any class</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>13</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>750,000</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>13</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</td></tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>14</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>1,000,000</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>14</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Guildmaster</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>15*</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>1,500,000</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>15</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Grandmaster Assassin</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t</tbody></table>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>* Level 15 at 1,500,000 experience points is the ceiling for assassins.

At other times a strong compulsion is placed upon the user and he or she will not be able to rid him- or herself of it except by means of a remove curse spell.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<i>Intermittent Functioning: </i>Intermittently-functioning items tend to fall into three broad categories: <i>unreliable, uncontrolled, </i>and <i>dependent. Unreliable </i>items have a small chance of malfunctioning or not functioning at all each time they are activated, usually a natural 1 on a [[/roll 1d20]]. <i>Uncontrolled </i>items, on the other hand, have an unfortunate tendency to activate at completely random times. On a roll of 1 on [[/roll 1d20]] the item will activate at some random point during the day. <i>Dependent </i>items must have a specific condition or situation met or they will not function. A table of possible situations is included below for GM inspiration.

{"_id":"AgkFYG0rCtvrWZOx","name":"Potions","content":"<h1>Potions</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Although potions can be found in a variety of containers, including glass, ceramic, or metal flasks, most contain only one dose that imbues their potion's particular effects for one individual. Most potions bear no label and require a small amount to be sampled in order to attempt to identify the potion type. This is not without error, and potions of the same type may differ in their aroma or taste depending on how they were made.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>As a standard rule, potions take effect [[/roll 1d4+1]] segments after consumption, and last for [[/roll 1d4]] turns. This principle is superseded where the specific potion description indicates otherwise. Potions can normally be consumed in half doses, so that half the potion is consumed and operates for half the duration.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The creation of potions requires the joint efforts of magic users and alchemists unless the magic user is over 11th level. A sample of the potion to be created must be obtained at some point in order to learn the formula for the particular potion.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><h1>Admixture of Potions</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Magic potions store a great deal of eldritch energy and, as any alchemist or mage can attest, require a lot of careful preparation. The random admixture of potions can have unpredictable results and only the foolish or desperate will undertake such an action. Admixture of two or more potions has occurred when the liquid of one potion is mixed with that of another, or a potion is consumed while a previously consumed potion remains in effect. The former is considered an external admixture and the latter an internal one.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Presented here for the GM's consideration are a set of guidelines for handling these situations. A particularly industrious referee might wish to map out a complete matrix of effects to be used any time a potion is mixed with another. While this would be of use, the matrices would have to be updated with each introduction of a new potion. Additionally, the different formulations of a potion are not accounted for in such a matrix. OSRIC uses a set of guidelines combined with a random table to achieve a similar result with far less effort, as follows:</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Mixing a potion of clairaudience or clairvoyance with any other potion will stun anyone drinking the potion for [[/roll 1d4]] days </b>, due to massive sensory overload from uncontrolled telepathic input.

For example, the sub-table# column lists [[/roll 2d10]] for goblins (first level) encountered on the first level of the dungeon. If encountered on the third level of the dungeon, they would be three times as numerous ([[/roll 6d10]]).

They are the champions of lawful evil, and are the implacable foes of chaotic demonkind and all servants of good.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Devil society is organized into a strict hierarchy, which is never compromised for fear of retribution from the archdevils, who rule the planes of Hell. Nevertheless, squabbling and rivalries are common amongst devils. Amongst the archdevils themselves there also exists a hierarchy of barons, dukes, marquises, and princes - cause for considerable rivalry and jealousy.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>All devils can move between the various planes of Hell, although this usually requires permission from the archdevil who rules the particular plane. Devils may also move at will to Gehenna, Hades, and Acheron. Similarly, they can also travel to the Astral Plane, but this is rare. Devils are not allowed to enter the other planes (e.g. the Prime Material) without a proper summoning, a gate spell, or the invocation of their secret name (if they have one).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>All devils possess special, magical abilities which may vary according to individual type.

To actually slay a devil one must do so in the planes of Hell or a neighbouring lower plane. If its material form is slain, a devil must return to its home plane in Hell for nine decades of servitude as a lemure before it will resume its former status.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Once combat is joined with devils, <b>they can never be subdued. </b>In dire circumstances the major devils and archdevils may be willing to negotiate. <b>Lesser devils will madly fight to the death. </b>If it is to their advantage, <b>devils can split their attacks among 2 or more targets.</b></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Devils are exceptionally conscious of any kind of laws or contracts binding them to certain behaviour, and are profoundly adept at exploiting hidden loopholes. Negotiating with them can be quite tedious as every minute detail and exigency must be properly accounted for.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Just as when summoning a demon, proper inscription of a magical circle of protection is necessary for the conjurer's safety when attempting to summon a devil.

As the spell is cast, the character's material body enters a trance-like state of suspended animation while his or her consciousness enters the astral plane. The astral plane is a nexus with other planes of existence beyond, and the cleric may choose to enter these other planes of existence. If a character does transcend from the astral into another plane, he or she becomes a physical manifestation in that existence, forming a duplicate body identical to the one left in stasis back in the material plane. It is possible to travel astrally to other locations in the material plane, but a new body cannot be formed in a plane where the character already has a physical manifestation. While travelling in the astral plane, and after a new physical manifestation has formed on a plane beyond the astral, the character remains connected to his or her original body by a \"silver cord,\" an invisible, mystical link. If the silver cord is broken or severed (some threats in the astral plane can cause this to happen), the character dies, both on the material plane and in astral form.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Most magic items lose some or all of their power on the astral plane.

This score will be modified by damage he or she has taken, reducing Personality Score by 1 point for each group of hp equivalent to the character average hp per level.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>For example, Paula the Paladin is 8th level with a constitution score of 15 (+1 hp bonus per die) and 54 total hp. Average hp per level are 54 ÷ 8 = 6.75 and results are rounded off to 7. For every 7 hp of damage Paula sustains in combat, her personality level is reduced by 1.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Whenever personality conflict occurs, the sword will struggle with the player for dominance. The more often the conflict, the greater the struggle and the more unreasonable the demands the sword will make before being mollified.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Such a sword might insist the player fight a foe he or she would prefer to avoid or parley with - and perhaps seek to bring a fight about, calling out to reveal the character's hiding place, or shouting insults amidst delicate negotiations.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>In addition, some swords might insist on gemstones or filigree platinum inlay being added to their blade or pommel, or demand a scabbard made from the hide of a dragon or demon.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>If the personality score of the sword should ever become greater than that of the wielder, the sword will be able to dominate the player. The sword will be able to force any or all of the above upon the unfortunate player and, in addition, may refuse to strike a particular foe, or turn a swing so it strikes a comrade or even the sword's own wielder.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The above should be carefully adjudicated by the GM. A holy sword with a powerful personality in the hands of a dedicated paladin would be a dynamic force for good. A neutral good sword with a powerful personality in the hands of the same character might argue with the paladin constantly about how best to approach a situation. <b>An especially dominant or evil sword might even seek to pass into the possession of a weaker character, in order to more completely dominate him or her and be better able to seek its own ends.</b></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Unusual magic swords are like other creatures with a large ego: they will seek to become a force to be reckoned with in their world by being heavily involved in all party activities and especially in combat. <b>These weapons will also feel a strong sense of rivalry with other powerful magic weapons within 60-ft and will attempt to lead their wielder into dealing with the rival as the sword's alignment and the alignment of the rival dictates. </b>A chaotic evil sword would seek the destruction of the rival weapon, but a lawful good sword would seek to rescue and recruit a rival weapon to serve its own cause.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Swords of unusual nature are never completely dominated or silenced. </u>Even if greatly outweighed by the owner's personality the sword will be quick to inject its opinion into any discussion, always attempting to gain influence over the player and his or her companions.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>GMs should be ready to play the personality of these swords to the (ahem) hilt, enforcing the quirks and selfish demands of the weapon upon the player at every chance. <b>Play this sword as if it is your very own character, an especially greedy and egotistical one, and strive to the utmost for every gain you can garner for the sword. </b>The role-playing possibilities are endless.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"I0IQ9ef7ZhLd66iw":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"18b727066b1ab64e4254cf70f10f8b9b6f616039","sourceId":"JournalEntry.FGIsvLehQosafAad"},"cf":{"id":"temp_nd3mrw0y5","path":"OSRIC-GM#/CF_SEP/Chapter 6: Treasure#/CF_SEP/Magic Swords","color":"#000000"}}}

The penitent must be truly repentant of the deed, unless he or she is affected in such a way that would preclude repentance (such as in the case of someone whose alignment has been magically altered, or who is unconscious, charmed, or insane). In addition to removing the effects and supernatural consequences of evil actions, this spell may be used to negate, undo, or dispel a magical alignment change. Intentional misdeeds cannot be cleansed away by this spell. A cleric can, of course, use this spell to perform atonements for unintentional acts of goodness as well as evil, or for violations of neutral alignment. However, unless the GM rules otherwise based on circumstances, a cleric who is not true neutral cannot perform atonements for an alignment that the cleric does not, in some part, share.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"I0IQ9ef7ZhLd66iw":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"a6e2f2dffb0a801b23659c6c982fd858c2bceafd","sourceId":"JournalEntry.FitFUdZ6P10JfO3a","defaultPermission":2},"cf":{"id":"temp_21dytxls6ry","path":"OSRIC-PC#/CF_SEP/Chapter 2: Spells#/CF_SEP/Cleric Spells","color":"#000000"}}}

A homonculus will never willingly exceed the maximum communication range. The homonculus is completely under control of its creator, who need not concentrate on control to maintain it.

Within 24 hours of the alchemist completing the mixture process the magic user must cast the following spells upon the fluid, in order: mending, mirror image, and wizard eye. The spells must be cast by the person who gave the blood for the basic mixture (though scrolls may be used). Failure to cast the spells within 24 hours or casting the required spells out of order ruins that mixture and the whole process and all costs must be repeated.

Players may be tempted to load their characters up with too much gear, burdening movement and restricting their fighting capability. Naturally, there is a limit to what an adventurer can reasonably carry, and a character weighted down with every conceivable piece of equipment will soon find that it is best to be selective in choosing how much to carry. If for no other reason, those same sacks and backpacks need to be empty enough to carry out the vast troves of coins and other treasure the party expects to find! Moreover, if the party must flee from pursuers, it may not be important to be the fastest, but it is of crucial importance not to be the slowest!</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The most weight a character can carry is 150 lbs, plus whatever additional weight is allowed for the character's strength. This additional weight allowance permitted by the character's strength is simply subtracted from the weight on the table below to determine a character's level of encumbrance.

The GM must apply common sense to determinations of encumbrance, taking into account the fact that an extraordinarily bulky item, even if it is quite light, will be so unwieldy as to encumber a character. The bulk of listed armour and items is already taken into account for purposes of convenience.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>However, keep in mind that a character wearing armour has a maximum movement rate based on that armour, independent of all weight calculations (due to bulkiness).

Whilst it is possible to retain such hirelings for short periods, few will agree to a term of less than a month and most expect to serve considerably longer. It is therefore usual for expert hirelings to only be retained by player characters who have already established a stronghold or the equivalent. The maintenance of a stronghold is assumed to include any common hirelings necessary, but expert hirelings must be accounted for separately.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Whilst some may certainly be found in small villages, the probability of finding expert hirelings willing to take service with a player character is considerably higher in larger settlements, such as towns and cities, where suitable candidates exist in greater numbers.

The monthly costs assume that the hirelings in question are quartered in or near the stronghold of a player character and may not suffice in other circumstances. Moreover, a higher rate of pay or otherwise favourable treatment will be required to improve the morale and loyalty of a hireling.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Expert Hireling

A level seven magic user requires the aid of an alchemist to create magical potions; by level eleven such assistance is no longer needed, but will reduce the cost and time involved by half if available. In general, alchemists must be sought in cities.

An architect requires payment by the month, even for short projects, and expects to receive an additional sum equal to one tenth of the building costs. Unless the construction site was approved by an architect, there is a three in four chance that any structure will collapse within a month to a few years of completion.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Engineer (Artillerist): </b>Mandatory for the construction and correct operation of siege weapons, such as the trebuchet or ballista. Any attempt to build or use such weapons correctly without the aid of such an engineer will surely fail. If retained for only a few months at a time, this specialist demands higher pay, perhaps as much as sixty percent above the standard wage.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Engineer (Miner and Sapper): </b>Indispensable for the overseeing of any mining operations, underground construction, or siege and counter siege works that involve trenches, fortifications, assault towers and other similar siege devices. A dwarf engineer of this sort is required if dwarf miners are employed; he will demand twice the standard wage, but increase the productivity of any human miners by one fifth.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Jeweller and Gemcutter: </b>Able to speedily and accurately appraise the value of most gems, jewellery and other precious objects, a jeweller is also capable of repairing, enhancing or newly creating ornamented items and jewellery. Simple tasks, such as setting a stone in the hilt of a sword or the forging of a plain ring, might take only a few days to a week, whilst more complex undertakings, such as producing a gem studded bracelet, could take up to a month; of course, truly opulent and intricate items might take a year or more.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Often a jeweller is also skilled at cutting gems; just as in their former capacity they may increase the value of an item through their craft, as a gemcutter they may increase the value of poorly cut stones, usually those worth less than five thousand gold pieces. However, the level of proficiency an individual possesses with regard to each skill varies and must be determined by the game master. A dwarf of this profession often possesses a greater degree of general ability than a human, but commands twice the pay. A gnome may be no better a jeweller than a human, but they are typically of even greater skill than a dwarf when it comes to gemcutting, and can also ask for twice the standard wage.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Mercenaries: </b>The numbers, type and frequency of men at arms available in a given settlement are at the discretion of the game master, but a chart is provided below with suggested probability distributions. In general, when a group of six to ten mercenaries of the same type is encountered they will be led by a sergeant; larger groups will be led by a lieutenant or captain, as appropriate, and include sufficient sergeants to keep the regular soldiers in order. There must be an officer, such as a captain, for each body of mercenaries that a player character wishes to

Similarly, the prospect of raising militias and levies is not addressed here, their quality depending on many factors, but in most cases being inferior to that of professional soldiery.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>As with most standard hirelings, very few men at arms will agree to serve for periods of less than a month and sergeants, lieutenants and captains will never agree to serve for such a limited duration. Mercenaries retained on a short term basis will rarely agree to perform dangerous duties unless paid considerably more than the standard sum; indeed, thirty times the daily wage is typically demanded.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Artillerist: </b>Required for the operation of siege weapons and other engines of war; in desperate circumstances, artillerists will fight in the manner of light footmen. Typical equipment includes studded armour, short sword, and dagger.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Bowman, Long: </b>Expert in the use of powerful bows, long bowmen also serve as light footmen when required. Typical equipment includes studded armour, long bow, quiver with twelve arrows, and hand axe.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Bowman, Short: </b>Proficient in the use of bows, short bowmen can also fight as light footmen, but usually will not. Typical equipment includes studded armour, short bow, quiver with twelve arrows, and hand axe.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Bowman(Mounted): </b>Skilled at shooting from the saddle, but generally unwilling to close to melee; mounted bow- men have a reputation for poor discipline. Typical equipment includes a light warhorse with gear, studded armour, short bow, quiver with twelve arrows, and hand axe.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Captain: </b>Equivalent to a fifth to eighth level fighter, but incapable of conventional advancement by level. A captain may lead twenty men at arms and one lieutenant for every level of experience he possesses, as well as the necessary number of sergeants; the monthly wage demanded by a captain is equal to his level multiplied by 100 gold pieces.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Crossbowman: </b>Practiced in the use of crossbows and willing to fight as light footmen when required. A heavy crossbowman will often require a light footman to shield him whilst reloading. Typical equipment includes studded armour, light crossbow, quiver with twelve light bolts, and hand axe.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Crossbowman (Mounted): </b>Trained to shoot and reload light crossbows from horseback, mounted crossbowmen are also willing to fight hand to hand when necessary. Typical equipment includes a light warhorse with gear, studded leather, light crossbow, quiver with twelve light bolts, and light pick.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Footman, Heavy: </b>Intended primarily for fighting and manoeuvring in close order on open ground, heavy footmen employ the appropriate arms and armour. Typical equipment includes scale armour, halberd, and short sword.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Footman, Heavy (Mounted): </b>Familiar enough with horses to ride them, but not trained to fight from horseback, mounted heavy footmen dismount to fight. Horses need to be looked after during combat, which requires one man for every four mounts. Typical equipment includes a riding horse with gear, scale armour, halberd, and short sword.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Footman, Light: </b>Accustomed to fighting in open order and traversing broken or rough terrain, light footmen are armed and armoured accordingly. Typical equipment includes studded armour, large shield, spear, and handaxe.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Footman, Light (Mounted): </b>Familiar enough with horses to ride them, but not trained to fight from horseback, mounted light footmen dismount to fight. Horses need to be looked after during combat, which requires one man for every four mounts. Typical equipment includes a riding horse with gear, studded armour, large shield, spear, and hand axe.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Horseman, Heavy: </b>Most effective when attacking in very close order on open terrain, heavy horsemen are well armed and fearsome in combat. Typical equipment includes a heavy warhorse with gear, mail barding, mail armour, large shield, lance, long sword, and dagger.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Horseman, Medium: </b>Capable of delivering a powerful charge over open ground and in close order, well used medium horsemen can prove decisive. Typical equipment includes a medium warhorse with gear, scale barding, scale armour, large shield, lance, broadsword, and dagger.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Horseman, Light: </b>Swift in pursuit and quick to retreat, light horsemen fight in open order and make excellent skirmishers. Typical equipment includes a light warhorse with gear, leather barding, studded armour, small shield, lance, and hand axe.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Lieutenant: </b>Equivalent to a second or third level fighter, but incapable of conventional advancement by level. A lieutenant may lead ten men at arms for every level of experience he possesses, as well as the necessary number of sergeants; in addition, he may command a number of unassigned sergeants equal to his level. When serving a captain, only the lieutenant counts against the number of men that may be led. The monthly wage demanded by a lieutenant is equal to his level multiplied by 100 gold pieces.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Pikeman: </b>Trained to fight with long pikes and manoeuvre in close formation on flat terrain, pikemen will also fight as heavy footmen. Mixed formations of more than one hundred pikemen and heavy foot require at least two months of drilling to be effective. Typical equipment includes scale armour, pike, and short sword.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Sapper: Necessary for the use of assault towers, the construction or undermining of fortifications, and other siege works. Sappers fight in the manner of heavy footmen, but are usually lightly armoured and unwilling to engage in combat. Typical equipment includes studded armour, short sword, and dagger.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Sergeant: </b>Equivalent to a first level fighter, but incapable of conventional advancement by level. A sergeant can lead up to ten men independently or in service to a lieutenant or captain. In any given company, there must be one sergeant for every five to ten men at arms. The monthly wage required by a sergeant is ten times that of the troop type he leads.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Slinger: </b>Adept in the use of the sling to disrupt and harass the enemy, slingers are also able fight as light footmen, though they are generally restricted to light armour and weapons. Typical equipment includes studded armour, small shield, sling, pouch with twelve bullets, and hand axe.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Optional Rule: </b>At the discretion of the game master, a player character fighter of the appropriate level may serve as a sergeant, lieutenant or captain, as might an allied non- player character fighter or henchmen. A character of a related class, such as ranger or paladin, might also suffice if the circumstances warrant such an allowance.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Non-Human Mercenaries: </b>The opportunity to retain the services of non-human mercenaries is something that depends on an individual campaign milieu; however, it is typically more difficult than enlisting standard men at arms. Individuals of mixed ancestry, such as half elves or half orcs may be found amongst the ranks of either parentage.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>In general, demi-humans will only agree to take service with a champion of their race or in a cause that is directly in their interest, with the aid of elves being the most difficult to obtain. As an exception, dwarf mercenaries might, for double normal pay, be successfully recruited to fight in the causes of others.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Many humanoids, such as kobolds, goblins, orcs, hobgoblins, bugbears or gnolls, may take service with evil aligned characters that are powerful enough to master them or insidious enough to manipulate them. They may even serve for less than half pay, but such soldiery are given to breaches of discipline, vile behaviour, despoliation of any territory they pass through and the intolerable abuse or murder of any unfortunate inhabitants.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Sage: </b>The ultimate receptacle of knowledge and lore, a sage is a sort of mediæval research library contained in one being. The sage can be summed up as a person with a degree of knowledge on just about everything, a lot of knowledge in a few specific fields, and authoritative knowledge in his or her special fields of study.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>In game terms, the sage would be able to converse intelligently on a wide variety of subjects but would give very good advice in his or her field of study, authoritative advice in his or her special areas of research, and reasonable advice in one or two other fields. Keep in mind, too, that all this is relative - advice from a sage should never be lightly ignored, no matter the subject under discussion or area of study of the sage. Obviously, portraying such an individual presents a challenge: how much does the sage know and in what areas does he or she know it? The tables presented here should help the GM to fully answer those questions.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>First, the fields of specialty must be determined. As always, random generation scores are included but the GM should feel free to tailor a sage to campaign's needs. Be careful of meta-game questions or information. This is to say, the players should not be able to ask things about which the characters should have no knowledge, nor should the sage divulge information which she should not possess. If laser guns do not exist in your milieu, for instance, then no question concerning them should be answered.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Sage Ability Table</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<table>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tbody><tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>D%</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Minor Fields</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Special Categories in Major Field</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>01-10</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>11-30</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>31-50</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>4</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>51-70</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>71-90</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>91-00</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>4</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t</tbody></table>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Sage Fields of Study (d%)</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Humankind (01-30)</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<table>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tbody><tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Art</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Law</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Biology</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Politics</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Demography</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Psychology</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>History</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Religion</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Languages</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Sociology</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t</tbody></table>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Demi-humankind (31-40)</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<table>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tbody><tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Art</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Law</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Biology</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Politics</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Demography</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Psychology</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>History</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Religion</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Languages</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Sociology</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t</tbody></table>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Humanoids (41-50)</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<table>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tbody><tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Art</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Law</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Biology</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Politics</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Demography</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Psychology</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>History</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Religion</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Languages</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Sociology</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t</tbody></table>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Natural Philosophy (51-65)</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<table>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tbody><tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Alchemy</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Mathematics</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Architecture</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Meteorology</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Astronomy</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Metallurgy</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Chemistry</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Oceanography</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Geography</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Physics</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Geology</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Topography</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t</tbody></table>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Fauna (66-75)</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<table>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tbody><tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Amphibians</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Insects</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Arachnids</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Mammals</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Avians</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Marsupials</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Crustaceans &amp;

Picture the modern attorney and the considerable size of the libraries in his offices. This may give one an idea of the sheer volume of stored information a sage will wish to be able to access on demand. Sages are scholarly, eccentric types and a PC offering to hire one will be expected to provide private living spaces far away from noise and the bustle of activity. The minimum quarters a sage would accept would consist of four separate rooms of no less than 200 square-ft each: living quarters, study, library, and workroom. Depending upon the field of speciality, the sage may also request various other areas, such as a zoo for housing living creatures for study, or a greenhouse for the study of plants. The average sage will see the player as the opportunity for acquisition of additional materials for study and categorisation and will, in all likelihood, demand far more for his or her work than he or she will actually need. At any rate, the busier the sage is kept and the more often his or her studies are interrupted, the more materials and money he or she will likely demand.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Sage Characteristics: </b>If a sage is to be hired for a long period of time, his or her abilities and alignment should be determined as follows.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<table>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tbody><tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Strength: [[/roll 1d8+6]]</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Intelligence: [[/roll 1d4+14]]</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Dexterity: [[/roll 3d6]]</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Wisdom: [[/roll 1d6+12]]</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Constitution: [[/roll 2d6+3]]</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Charisma: [[/roll 2d6+3]]</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Alignment: see table below</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Hit Points: [[/roll 4d6]]</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t</tbody></table>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><table>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tbody><tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>d% Result</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>d% Result</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>01-05 Chaotic Evil</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>41-60 Lawful Neutral</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>06-10 Chaotic Good</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>61-80 Neutral</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>11-20 Chaotic Neutral</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>81-90 Neutral Evil</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>21-30 Lawful Evil</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>91-00 Neutral Good</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>31-40 Lawful Good</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t</tbody></table>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Special Skills: </b>Sages have limited ability in spell-casting granted to them by the sheer volume of knowledge they have accumulated and the type of spell is usually related to their field of speciality. The GM should determine whether the sage's spell-casting ability is arcane, phantasmal, divine or druidic when the sage is created, based on a judgement call rather than a random roll. Expertise in the field of magic, for instance, would indicate arcane spell ability. On the other hand a sage with extensive knowledge of trees would have druidic spell ability. Phantasmal magic might be associated with psychology and divine ability with astronomy.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Roll [[/roll 1d4+2]] to determine the maximum level of the spells the sage knows and [[/roll 1d4]] to generate the maximum number of spells known for each level. Spells memorised by the sage will normally be of utility to a non-adventuring type person, for example: unseen servant, read magic, locate object, or tongues. The sage will cast the spell at the minimum level required for a member of that class to cast the spell. Tongues, to take an instance from the above list, would be cast by the sage as a 5th level magic user. A sage will regard his or her spell knowledge as a closely kept secret and will not divulge this ability lightly.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Hiring A Sage: </b>Only fighters, rangers, paladins, thieves, and assassins may hire a sage; though other classes may consult with sages as need dictates. Hiring a sage will require the PC have a stronghold outfitted with space for the sage as indicated above. Sages will only accept a permanent offer of lifetime service.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Location of a Sage: </b>Sages are located in larger towns and in cities, particularly near universities, museums, libraries, and the like. Sages also have a somewhat informal brotherhood but there is nothing such as a guild house where one might inquire about hiring a sage. Any sage will have a general knowledge as to the whereabouts of most sages in the area. Likewise, the employment of any sage will quickly become common knowledge throughout the general area.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Short Term Employment - Consulting a Sage: </b>Players do not need to hire a sage before asking questions of one. Consultations last no more than 1 week, after which the sage will not be available to the players for the period of 1 month. Consultation fees run to 100 gp per day plus the amount shown on the tables in Information Discovery section below.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Long Term Employment: </b>As with most types of hirelings, sages agreeing to employment will show up with only the clothes on their backs and the shoes on their feet. Unlike other hirelings, however, the initial outlay of money and materials involved with employing a sage is considerable.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Support and salary, per month: </b>200 gp to 1,200 gp ([[/roll 2d6]]×100) Research grants, per month: 200 gp to 1,200 gp ([[/roll 2d6]]×100) Initial material expenditure: 20,000 gp minimum</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>This minimum initial material expenditure will allow the sage to operate at about 50% efficiency in performing research and providing information. Each extra 1,000 gp will increase efficiency by 1% until 90% is reached (60,000 gp).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Thereafter, each 1% increase will cost the employer a further 4,000 gp. This is to simulate the increasingly difficult acquisition of rare books and equipment. The proper setting and materials for the sage to operate at 100% efficiency cost a total of 100,000 gp.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The employer can spend still more money to increase the sage ability in both general and specific fields of study. For 5,000 gp and 1 month of uninterrupted study, the sage can increase ability outside of his or her field 1%, up to a maximum gain of 5%. For 10,000 gp and 1 month uninterrupted study time the sage can increase expertise in his or her minor fields of study by 1% up to a maximum gain of 5%. A minor field can be added, up to three maximum, for 100,000 gp and 2 years of study. A major field of study requires 200,000 gp and also requires an uninterrupted 2 years of study time.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Payment for such additional studies must be made in advance and if the sage is asked a question during that time the money is lost and effort wasted.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Information Discovery:</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Use the table below for determining fees and time required for information discovery. This table assumes research under the optimal condition of the sage having a stocked workshop with library and being located near a large town or city.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Location is important because the sage may need additional equipment or materials for additional research which simply would not be available in more rural settings. A sage located far from large population centres will probably require double the regular fee schedule and allotted time for research. In such a situation, after rolling on the Chance of Knowing the Answer to a Question table, roll d% again. For all categories except Special, if the second roll is 20% or less of the first percentage generated the sage knows the answer without having to conduct the research at the more expensive double rate, since the information he or she already has at hand is sufficient to answer the query.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>For example: </b>a sage in a remote location is asked specific question in an Out of Fields category. The GM rolls a 10 on a [[/roll 1d10]] and the table yields a result of 20%. The GM rolls d% again and if the result is 1 (20% of 20) the sage will be able to provide an answer at the regular cost; otherwise research time and cost will be doubled. For questions in the sage's special category of knowledge the spread increases to 80%. Fees for secondary questions based upon answers to a previous question are subject to the sage's reaction to the players; the GM must decide whether the fee is charged again, or partial, or waived. Unknown information will take from 50%-100% of allotted time to determine whether sage can answer the question, but will cost only half the standard rate.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The abbreviation \"r\" means \"rounds\", \"h\" means \"hours\", and \"d\" means \"days\".</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Information Discovery Time and Cost Table</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<table>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tbody><tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Question is:</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>General</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Specific</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Exacting</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Cost (gp)</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Out of Fields</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>[[/roll 1d6]]r</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>[[/roll 2d6]]d</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>-</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>100/d</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>In Minor Field</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>[[/roll 1d4]]r</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>[[/roll 2d10]]d</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>[[/roll 5d8]]d</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>1,000/d</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>In Major Field</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>[[/roll 1d3]]r</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>[[/roll 1d12]]d</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>[[/roll 3d10]]d</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>500/d</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>In Special Category</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>[[/roll 1d2]]r</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>[[/roll 1d10]]h</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>[[/roll 2d6]]d</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>200/d</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t</tbody></table>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Rest and Recuperation: </b>For every day spent in research the sage must spend 3 days resting. Interruptions during this down-time will result in additional days of rest and maximum costs and research times for any questions he or she is compelled to answer.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Demi-Human or Half-Human Sages: </b>Most sages are human but sometimes sages of other races will be encountered. Chances are they will not be interested in consulting with player characters - especially human PCs. As always, this rule depends upon their reaction to the players and the circumstances of the encounter.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Scribe: </b>Practiced in the art of writing, a typical scribe is expected to keep records, write letters and copy documents. Others may possess additional skills, such as cartography, counterfeiting, cryptography, illuminating or the ability to write, read or otherwise comprehend more than one language. Such accomplished individuals might command ten times the standard wage.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Ship Company: </b>The availability of crews and ships in a given port willing to take service with a player character is at the discretion of the game master. A vessel must normally be suited to the waters into which it will venture and the crew recruited appropriate to the ship, as well as familiar with its handling; a mixed crew, for instance, is required for vessels that employ both sail and oar. A vessel and crew intended for river travel will be unsuitable for coastal voyages, just as a ship built for coastal trading will be of little use on the open sea. If any of these criteria are left unmet, there will be a significant chance of mishap.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Every ship, no matter the size, requires a master, at least one lieutenant and a mate. In all respects other than those outlined below, these officers correspond to the mercenary captain, lieutenant and sergeant, respectively. The master of the ship will expect to receive one half share of any treasure taken for every full share a player character receives; each lieutenant will similarly expect to receive one tenth share and each mate one fiftieth, whilst at least a further tenth share is to be distributed between the crewmen.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Lieutenant: </b>Equivalent to a second or third level fighter, but incapable of conventional advancement by level. At least one lieutenant is required for every twenty crewmen or part thereof that makes up a ship's company, but not including mates. The monthly wage demanded by a lieutenant is equal to his level multiplied by 100 gold pieces.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Marine: </b>Trained primarily to repel and engage in boarding actions, marines otherwise fight in close order as heavy footmen. Typical equipment includes scale armour, large shield, spear, short sword, and hand axe.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Master: </b>Equivalent to a fifth to eighth level fighter, but incapable of conventional advancement by level. A ship must have a master of the appropriate type if it is to operate without fear of preventable disaster. The monthly wage required by a captain is equal to his level multiplied by 100 gold pieces.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Mate: </b>Equivalent to a first level fighter, but incapable of conventional advancement by level. At least one mate is required for every ten crewmen or part thereof that makes up a ship's company.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Oarsman: </b>Accustomed to protracted periods of steady rowing, oarsmen are well paid and willing to fight as heavy footmen. Typical equipment includes studded armour, small shield, short sword, and dagger.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Sailor: </b>Necessary for the operation of most sailing vessels, sailors will fight as light footmen, but are unwilling to wear body armour. Typical equipment includes small shield, short sword, and dagger.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Spy: </b>Recruited to secretly watch the actions of others and gather information, a spy could be anyone from an under-paid and unhappy chamber maid to a professional thief or assassin. A player character wishing to engage the services of a prospective informer must do his own convincing. Fees may vary wildly, from perhaps a mere hundred gold pieces to many thousands, depending on the individual and the difficulty of what is asked. The base probability of successfully completing a task ranges from ten to fifty percent, in accordance with its complexity, and modified as appropriate by taking into account the class and level of the spy. A character who is often involved in subterfuge may be treated as though a spy of a level equivalent to the number of successful assignments he has carried out, within reasonable limits. Of course, there is always a small chance that a spy will be discovered, especially during a lengthy and complex assignment, and failure may result in disappearance, death or betrayal.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Steward: </b>Responsible for the administration of a stronghold in the absence or inability of a player character, a steward holds a position of great prestige and trust. Usually, such an individual is promoted from the position of mercenary captain and will not afterwards take kindly to being asked to reassume that role, even temporarily. Whilst serving within the stronghold, a steward is capable of leading forty men at arms and two lieutenants for every level of experience he possesses, as well as the necessary number of sergeants. Given that a fortress is well provisioned, garrisoned and supported at the time at which he is appointed, a steward will see to it that such remains the case. Of course, if a player character expects his dependents to vigorously resist any enemy action in his absence or incapacity, he must ensure that the loyalty of such men is strongly maintained. The monthly wage due to a steward is equal to his level multiplied by one hundred gold pieces.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Optional Rule: </b>At the discretion of the game master, a henchman of the appropriate class and level might be appointed as steward, rather than a mercenary captain.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Weaponer: </b>Required for the production of complex weaponry and the maintenance of the arms of any soldiery; there must be at least one weaponer available for every sixty men at arms retained. Each must be provided with a workroom and forge at an additional cost, but sufficient apprentices and assistants are assumed in his monthly wage. Whilst otherwise unoccupied and given an initial month in which to prepare, or a year in the case of long and composite bows, a weaponer may produce various arms at the below rates and at a cost determined by the game master. A leatherer is necessary for the creation of scabbards and sheaths.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<table>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tbody><tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Weapon Type</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Days to Produce</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Bow, Long</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>6-15</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Bow, Composite</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>6-15</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Crossbow, Heavy</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Scimitar</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Sword, Bastard</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>3.75</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Sword, Broad</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Sword, Long</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>2.5</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Sword, Short</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>1.5</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Sword, Two Handed</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>6</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Other</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t</tbody></table>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>At the discretion of the game master, specialist weaponers may be required for the making of some weapons.

If the range is \"caster,\" this indicates that the spell moves with the caster.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Spell duration refers to the length of time that the spell's magic remains \"magical.\" Thus a permanent duration means that the spell creates an enchantment (which can probably be dispelled). A spell with instantaneous duration is a spell that causes a permanent change in the world, but one that no longer requires a spell to maintain. The effect of a spell with instantaneous duration cannot later be dispelled. The cleric's cure spells are an excellent example: once a wounded person is cured, the regained hit points cannot be removed with a dispel magic spell, but they are not magically protected from being removed with a sword stroke, either. The spell is simply complete once it is cast, and no more magic is active after that point. Spells marked with \"Instantaneous (permanent)\" under \"duration\" all have this property-they cannot be removed by being dispelled.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Spell components may be verbal (representing the words used to incant the spell), somatic (representing the gesture or gestures that must accompany the casting), and/or material (representing physical components that are normally consumed in the spell's casting). Exception: Material components that are not normally consumed include a cleric's holy symbol.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Spells with a verbal component may not be cast within the area of effect of a silence spell or if the caster is gagged. Spells with a somatic component will require that the caster has at least one hand free for the casting. Spells with a material component will usually require two free hands as well as the material component itself.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The precise nature of the material component for most spells has been left as a matter for the GM to determine, if relevant. Where such components are costly, an approximate cost is provided. Otherwise, the components should not usually be rare or difficult to acquire.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>As typical examples, the spell fireball might require explosive materials such as charcoal or saltpetre, while the spell sleep might require a pinch of sand thrown towards the targets at the culmination of the spell.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>It is possible for high level magic users and illusionists to research new spells. Such spells should be assigned a level by the GM which should be commensurate with the approximate power of the spell. The GM should always ensure that such spell research is difficult, demanding, dangerous and very, very expensive!</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The spell names provided are generic, and may (or should) be adjusted for additional flavour and relevance to the particular campaign in question.

{"_id":"Hxw7IikSmdvnwAWP","name":"Henchmen","content":"<h1>Henchmen</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Henchmen are classed and leveled non-player character adventurers in the service of higher level player characters. A third level magic user, for instance, might take on a first level fighter henchman to act as his personal guard. However, the henchmen of a player character are more significant than mere hirelings; they become his companions, friends, and supporters, acting in his interests even in his absence. Indeed, a very loyal henchman may sacrifice his very life in defence of a player character or charge unbidden into the thick of the fray to rescue him. Consequently, henchmen are highly sought after by experienced players, and the number a character may have is limited by his charisma score.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Demographics: </b>The number of henchmen available in a particular locale depends on the total population, and its predisposition towards attracting adventurer types. A prosperous trading city with 30,000 inhabitants might have 300 characters capable of level advancement, but only 1 in 10 of them are likely to be available and interested in serving as henchmen. The incidence of adventurers may be higher or lower, depending on the settlement, its circumstances, and the assumptions of the campaign milieu, perhaps varying by as much as a factor of five or more in either direction.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Recruiting: </b>There are four basic ways in which a player character may attempt to locate a henchman, and each may be attempted only once a month, either individually or in combination. Hiring a public crier costs 10 gp, and will attract [[/roll 1d10]]% of those available, whilst posting notices in prominent places costs 50 gp to draw [[/roll 10d4]]% of the same. Using agents is costly at 300 gp, but will bring [[/roll 5d10]]% of potential henchmen, and a minimum of 10%. A character willing to frequent the various inns and taverns available will induce [[/roll 1d4]]% for every 10 gp spent ingratiating themselves with patrons and staff, to a maximum of [[/roll 5d4]]%, but every such establishment visited, up to a maximum of ten, reduces the effectiveness of the others by 1%. Furthermore, each method used in combination beyond the first reduces the sum by 5%.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Response: </b>The modified total resulting from recruitment efforts is the percentage of all available potential henchmen that respond. Following the first efforts at recruitment, applicants will appear over the course of [[/roll 2d4]] days. If the player character is not present at the agreed place when an individual seeks them out, then that recruiting opportunity is lost. Casting spells upon a prospective henchmen will result in an unfavourable response, though if they consent an exception might be made for know alignment or detect good/evil. Direct questions about alignment and other breaches of etiquette will also be poorly received.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Characteristics: </b>Only relate to the interviewing player character what can be detected by normal observational means. Do not blurt out the character's alignment, constitution score, or level. Instead, allow a general idea of these attributes only as a reward to careful questioning on the part of the interviewer.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Race: </b>The race of each respondent depends on the locality, and should be in proportion to the established racial demographic. That is to say, if the above prosperous trading city has a human population of 24,000, then 80% of candidates should be of that race. If you wish to reflect a higher incidence of adventurers in the Demi-human population, then consider doubling the number who respond.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Class: </b>Use the table below to randomly determine class of applicants. Once characteristics are known, and given that the prospective character qualifies, there is a 1 in 10 chance that a fighter will actually be a ranger, and the same that he will be a paladin. There is similarly a 1 in 6 chance that a magic user will be an illusionist, that a cleric will be a druid, or that a thief will be an assassin, given that the candidate meets the requirements for such a class. Demi-humans may have two or three classes, if they have two scores greater than 13 in the relevant characteristics, and always assuming that they otherwise qualify.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><table>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tbody><tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>D%</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Class</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>01-40</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Fighter</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>41-60</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Magic User</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>61-80</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Cleric</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>91-00</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Thief</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t</tbody></table>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Level: </b>Newly recruited henchmen are generally first level characters.

This apparent lack of success as an independent adventurer is the main reason he is seeking the position of henchman, and the offer must therefore include complete equipment in accordance with his class(es). Any magic items useful to the character will typically increase the chance of acceptance by 15%, magical ammunition counting only in groups of six.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Room and Board: </b>The potential henchman always expects this. Not including an offer of free room and board decreases the chance of acceptance by 25%.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Treasure: </b>The player character must explain to the prospective henchman his specific duties and what is more generally expected. The henchman will want to know what percentage of treasure will be apportioned, and what to expect with regards to magic items. In addition to living expenses, henchmen typically receive a half-share of the treasure gained on a given expedition; they will also expect healing and other restorative spells as needs dictate.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>The Offer: </b>If the player character tenders an offer the game master must tally up all the percentage modifiers listed above and add any charisma adjustment indicated. This is the offer acceptance chance; if the number rolled does not exceed this chance, then the non-player character accepts service as a henchmen.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Exceptional Henchmen: </b>In certain circumstances, a player character may have a relatively high level non-player character in his power, which may then lead to an offer of henchman status. In general, if such a character is more than two levels higher than the player character he will accept only associate status for one or two adventures. No inducement will cause him to willingly accept a longer period of service. However, if the player character is more than two levels higher than the non-player character then an offer may be made normally in accordance with the above guidelines. In any other circumstances, the non-player character will agree to accept associate status for only [[/roll 1d4]] weeks or adventures. If an offer is accepted under threat, then the character will likely be of questionable loyalty.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Associates: </b>Typically, an associate non-player character regards himself as being the equal of any player characters, or perhaps their better; he may have been coerced, hired, or joined the party of his own free will and for his own ends. Regardless such characters expect to be treated as a true member of the group, taking their fair share of the risks, and receiving a full share of any treasure or magic items gained.

{"_id":"JtUIUxKyGWeIqqyM","name":"Ability Scores","content":"<h1>Ability Scores</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A character's basic attributes are represented in the game by six \"ability scores.\" These abilities are Strength (Str), Dexterity (Dex), Constitution (Con), Intelligence (Int), Wisdom (Wis), and Charisma (Cha). The first three represent the character's physical qualities, and the second three his or her mental ones. Each of these abilities is represented by a number from 3-18, the higher the better. The Game Master (\"GM\") will decide how you should generate these scores. For a truly brutal game, characters are generated using [[/roll 3d6]] for each ability in order. Because these numbers will be relatively low (compared to other methods for generating scores, described hereafter) and cannot be switched around, the players will be forced to use their utmost skill in creating a party of adventurers from whatever raw material the dice hand to them.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Many GMs will allow the players to roll up six ability scores and then decide which scores will go with which ability. This gives the players more flexibility to create a good party and to decide among themselves who will be playing which class. A player may come to the table wanting to play a particular type of character, and unless the gamers agree that they want to test their skills with a completely random challenge it is usually best to let the players take on the fantasy roles that satisfy them most.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>As well as eliminating or reducing the randomness of a character's strengths and weaknesses, the GM may also allow players a bit of a numerical advantage. Many GMs permit ability scores to be rolled using [[/roll 4d6]], dropping the result of the lowest die. This method, obviously, will tend to result in higher scores.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><h1>Strength</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Strength (\"Str\") is a measure of physical power, and is the most important attribute for fighters. If a fighter, paladin, or ranger character rolls an 18 strength, the player then rolls a d%, and that number is added as a decimal, or percentage, to the 18 strength. (See the table below for details.) A roll of 00 on the percentage die indicates a strength score of 19. Members of other classes cannot naturally gain strength in excess of 18.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The following table summarises the bonuses and penalties for strength scores.

{"_id":"LbuIS7LWQWghzJou","name":"Multi-Classing and Dual-Classing","content":"<p>Multi-classing, which is an option available only to non-human characters, is simultaneous advancement in two or more different classes. Dual-classing, an option available only to human characters, is the ability to switch classes and begin advancing exclusively in a new character class. Specific information about the interaction of the restrictions and abilities of a multi-classed character are described in the racial description of each race. Gnomish multi-classed characters are, for example, limited to leather armour in order to cast spells, while elven multi-classed characters are not. These restrictions reflect the particular nature of the non-human races and thus are detailed in the race descriptions. There is a general rule, however, that a cleric/fighter may use edged weapons. When a non-human character has more than one character class, any experience points gained by the character will be divided evenly between these two classes, even once the character can no longer progress in one of the classes.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Multi-class characters may choose which of their classes' tables they use for combat and saving throws. So for example, a cleric/fighter normally uses the fighter attack charts and the cleric saving throw matrices.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>When the character advances in one of his or her classes, additional hit points are determined by rolling the appropriate die (d4 for magic users and illusionists, [[/roll 1d6]] for thieves and assassins, etc.), adding the appropriate constitution modifier, and dividing by the number of classes involved (so two for a cleric/thief, or three for a fighter/cleric/magic user, for example).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>It is therefore entirely possible for a multi-class character to be at different levels of experience in different classes. As an extreme example, a half-orcish cleric/assassin of level 4/15 is possible.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Optional Rule: Some GMs limit elven and half-elven fighter/magic users and fighter/magic user/clerics in respect of the armour they may wear while casting spells. If this optional rule is in play, such a character may only cast arcane spells if unarmoured - unless they are wearing elfin chain. The character may still cast divine spells regardless of the armour he or she is wearing. (This rule assumes that elfin chain is specially designed to allow fighter/magic users to wear it.)</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Dual-class characters are humans who elect to change irrevocably from one class to another. The character class of a non-human represents talents and abilities that are somewhat more innate than those of humankind. Humans are more flexible and can generally become more skilled in any one class than non-humans, but lacking the innate talents of the other races, they can only focus upon one class at a time.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>In order to switch from one class to another, the human character must have an ability score of 15+ in the prime requisite(s) of the original class, and of 17+ in the prime requisite(s) of the new class. The character retains his or her hit points. He or she can use the particular abilities of the original class, but doing so will cause the character to forfeit all experience points from that adventure (as determined by the GM). This restriction applies until the character has advanced in the new class to a level at least one higher than was attained in the original class.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>When the character begins the process of learning a new class, he or she gains the abilities of the new class as a first level member of that class, and all experience is applied to progressing in the new class. The character gains no additional hit points until reaching a level in the new class one higher than in the original class, after which time the character's hit points advance as per the new class.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Unlike multi-class characters, dual-classed characters cannot perform the functions of several different classes simultaneously.

himself. Being outnumbered or outclassed by enemies in a combat situation is a good example, as is the death, capture or incapacitation of leaders. Acts of dishonour or evil may lower morale, just as acts of heroism and charity might raise it, depending on the alignment and disposition of the characters or monsters in question.

In such circumstances, a [[/roll 1d100]] is rolled and if the result is higher than the adjusted loyalty score of the character, then he gives into temptation.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<table>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tbody><tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Adjusted Loyalty Score</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Loyalty</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>&lt; 01</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>None: Could desert or worse at any time.</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>01-25</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Disloyal: Will seek personal gain at all times.</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>26-50</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Somewhat Loyal: Will serve, but exploit any advantage to the full.</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>51-75</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Fairly Loyal: Will perform routine tasks most of the time.</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>76-100</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Loyal: Will attempt to serve, even in difficult situations.</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>&gt; 100</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Fanatical: Will serve unquestioningly and fight to the death</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t</tbody></table>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>General Note: </b>The acquisition of henchmen and hirelings is key to long term success for player characters in the ongoing campaign. They provide a support structure that can help to minimise the worst misfortunes of defeat and reinforce the achievements of victory. Henchmen may even become prominent themselves, perhaps even becoming independent upon the death or retirement of the player character. However, non-player characters should not be treated lightly nor taken for granted; they should react in believable ways and pursue their own ambitions and interests when such seems reasonable. It is the responsibility of the game master to ensure that they are portrayed in a manner that keeps the game challenging for the players.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"I0IQ9ef7ZhLd66iw":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"272c8d05e929da91e639881587267239cbc936ee","sourceId":"JournalEntry.N4rI89BgfRdgdrLK","defaultPermission":2},"cf":{"id":"temp_hv1k4qd50gj","path":"OSRIC-PC#/CF_SEP/Chapter 3: How to Play#/CF_SEP/Hirelings and Henchmen","color":"#000000"}}}

In death they have become abominations, compelled by evil sorcery to serve any who possess the golden circlets that contain their souls. Skeleton Warriors desire above all else to gain possession of their own circlet and to be revenged upon any who have possessed and used it in the past.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The appearance of a Skeleton Warrior is terrifying and <b>creatures with less than five HD will panic and flee from its presence.</b></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A visage of desiccated and decaying flesh hanging from exposed bone is perhaps fearsome enough, but the flame red-eyes that stare forth from black sockets are said to haunt the dreams of those upon whom they look. They are generally armed and armoured with the remains of what they wore in life, or their grave goods.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A character in possession of the circlet of a Skeleton Warrior and within 240 ft may attempt to dominate it.

If the attempt fails, it may be attempted again on the following round. <b>If concentration is interrupted before domination is achieved, such as by an attack, the character must concentrate for a further three rounds </b>.

{"_id":"OQhFKDFqBjU7pl1a","name":"Dungeon Dressing","content":"<h1>Dungeon Dressing</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A dungeon or other adventure setting is more than merely monsters and treasures. The clever GM will draw the players into the world by serving as their eyes and ears. Compare and contrast the following statements:</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Example #1: </b>\"Your party travels down the 60-ft corridor without incident and arrives at a locked door.\"</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Example #2: </b>\"With the thief scouting for traps in front of the party, you proceed slowly down the corridor. The guttering torchlight throws eerie, flickering shadows upon the walls, revealing darker stone and cruder workmanship than that of the previous level. Unfortunately the torchlight doesn't shed enough light to see to the end, all you can see by the yellow flame is the corridor continuing on into the darkness 40-ft away. A faint current of icy cold air blows into your faces, carrying with it a dank and mouldy smell as the thief pauses for a moment, looking at something on the damp stone floor before continuing. As you pass by you note the badly dented helmet he was examining. It appears damaged beyond all use. From somewhere behind comes the faint sound of slithering - perhaps the sound of one of the many pests inhabiting the lower levels of the dungeon, or is it something more? After travelling about 60-ft, you arrive at a solid looking door, its heavy wood beams solidly bound with rusting iron. The slithering noise has ceased, for now.\"</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Both passages describe the same 60-ft trek down an empty corridor to a door. Compare the dry and somewhat terse language of the first with the complete involvement of the player's senses contained in the second: the GM describes what the characters see, smell, and hear. They have arrived at the door and are very likely wondering what may be prowling the corridor behind them, just outside of the range of their puny torches. It's a harmless pest, but the players don't know that; the GM is simply telling them what the characters hear. Now contrast the two door descriptions. The players go from a rather bland statement about the door being locked, information to which they should not yet have access, to almost seeing the patches of rust on the sturdy iron bindings and wondering if they will easily get through the door.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>It is about this method of filling out the dungeon with sensory input for the players that this section of the OSRIC rules speaks. It is called <b><i>dungeon dressing </i></b>and, as we saw above, dungeon dressing can elevate a mundane trip down 60-ft of corridor from an interlude into an experience. Tables are provided for random generation or, as always, the GM may pick and choose specific items for maximum effect. Note the tables are best served in areas otherwise lacking features of note. That is to say, the nuances of your carefully crafted sights, sounds, and smells may be lost upon the party battling for their lives against a horde of skeleton warriors. Although random tables are included, results should still be edited for a degree of consistency.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><h1>Air Currents Table</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDungeon Dressing

{"_id":"OTojeengiuGQ53b2","name":"Sample Play Session","content":"<h1>Sample Play Session</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Background: </b>A party of stalwart adventurers, consisting of Hogarth, human fighter and party caller (player: Bob), Alice, human magic user (player: Mary), Friar Chuck, human cleric (player: Chuck), Groin, dwarf fighter (player: Jason), Floppinjay, elf thief (player: Eric), and Hap, normal man mule-tender(NPC). They are searching for a way down to the ancient ruins of the Temple of the Serpent-Men, long sought and thought by most sensible folk to be only a legend until a recent earthquake opened a deep crevasse and turned up some unusual objects of unmistakably ancient origin.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>GM: </b>After a couple hours searching through the foothills and scrubland to the south and west of the crevasse you've come across something interesting - a small cave-entrance with a shallow stream flowing into it and evidence of foot traffic going both in and out. The cave entrance is approximately 100 yards west of the crevasse where the ruins are. It's now about noon.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Bob: </b>Can we tell anything about the tracks - what made them? How many individuals? Do the tracks appear fresh?</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>GM: </b>Whatever made the tracks was about Man-sized and wearing shoes or boots. You're pretty sure there were multiple individuals, not just one person going repeatedly in and out, and most of the tracks appear fairly fresh. You can't really tell anything beyond that without a ranger or other woodsman-type.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Bob: </b>Okay, the elf will go down into the cave and scout it out.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Eric: </b>Why me?</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Bob: </b>Because you're a thief so you're sneaky and less likely to get surprised by any monsters that might be lurking down there, and you're an elf so you can see in the dark.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Eric: </b>Okay, then, I do what he says - cautiously enter the cave with my sling out, making sure not to step in the stream. What do I see?</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>GM: </b>The cave-entrance is about 10-ft wide and 8-ft high and descends gently as it winds to the north and east. About 30-ft in it turns to the east so you can't see beyond that from where you're standing. It appears to grow narrower as it goes deeper, so if you're going to keep following it, eventually you're going to have to be standing in the stream.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Eric: </b>Do I hear anything?</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>GM: </b>[rolls] Just the sound of water dripping and splashing on the rocks.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Eric: </b>I'll cautiously move up to the eastward turn and look in that direction - what do I see?</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>GM: </b>Beyond the curve the passage keeps descending and narrowing, and winding in a northeasterly direction. You can see about 40-ft farther, by which point the passage has narrowed to about 4-ft wide and 7-ft tall, filled entirely by the stream.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Eric: </b>Okay, from where I'm standing I poke into the stream with my short- sword. How deep is it? How swiftly is it moving?</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>GM: </b>It's not deep, only a foot or two. It's not moving very quickly either, though a bit faster here than at the surface, and it looks to be moving a bit quicker up ahead too. You'd have no trouble standing upright in the middle of it.

By this point the passage is 4-ft wide and 7-ft high and you're all standing in the stream, which is about 2-ft deep.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Jason: </b>How deep underground are we?</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>GM: </b>[rolls] Not too far, maybe 15-ft.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Bob: </b>We continue forward.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>GM: </b>Alright. The passage goes east for 10-ft, 20-ft, and curves to the northeast. The slope levels a bit here, the depth of the stream increases to about 3-ft, and the current slows a bit. Over the next 30-ft the passage widens slightly and about 30-ft farther ahead from where you are now the passage appears to widen out into a cavern.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Bob: </b>Okay, we proceed forward cautiously, still in single file.

Nonetheless, he decides, on a roll of 01-05 he might hear something unusual: rolls (79)] Same as before. Splashing and dripping water; nothing more. As you move forward 10-ft, 20-ft, 30-ft the passage opens out into a wider cavern - bigger than the radius of your torchlight. You're entering via the southwest corner.

The 2 orcs fled down the southeast passage. The ceiling is about 15-ft high in the centre of the cavern, about 8-ft high on the two passages, much lower on the stream going north. West of the stream there's nothing but dirt and rocks. On the east side there are piles of sleeping skins, vile looking foodstuffs, waterskins, and a crude table that appears to have a pair of dice and some coins on it.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Eric: </b>I check out the table.

You find a few copper and silver coins but nothing else of interest in the bedding. None of the orcs appears to be a leader-type; none of them has any treasure or unusual item aside from a few more copper and silver coins.

If they use the trap to protect their lair, treasure or young, they will maintain the trap to the best of their ability (perhaps cleaning away bloodstains or other evidence of its existence, for example). And if the player characters learn to bypass the trap, intelligent monsters may try to find a way of making it effective again - perhaps by moving it or adding additional features, according to their ability and resources.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>When placing traps, think about their purpose in the game and the effect they will have on playing style. Traps are there to increase \"the risk of dungeoneering and to encourage skilled play; good dungeons have a judicious mixture of monsters, traps and roleplaying encounters.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Let's consider two OSRIC GMs. </b>One likes to use many traps, some of which cause instant death with no save, while another prefers to use much fewer traps and always permits a saving throw.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The first GM's players will adapt. They will move slowly and carefully through the dungeon, and may have summoned creatures or created zombies to move ahead of them; triggering any traps they might encounter. They will tend to capture prisoners and question them under charm or some similar magic about the dungeon environment, and evil aligned characters may use captives like mining canaries. The pace of play will be slow owing to the characters' caution.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The second GM's players will tend not to be thieves. They will move more rapidly through the dungeon to try to achieve surprise against any foes they might encounter, and the game will have a more heroic feel to it.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Decide which style

The caster may only be attacked directly if the attack is made before the blink takes place. </u>If the caster teleports both from and into an area which is affected by an area-of-effect spell, he will suffer its effects.

The vines are mobile enough to cover the evidence of the plant's peculiar feeding habits.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Amber Zombies </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</b>have varying appearances but are always human, demi-human, or humanoid. Succumbing to the amber creeping vine turns the skin amber and changes the eyes into glazed and lifeless parodies of their former appearance. <b>The process of draining a victim's intelligence also plants a vine seed into the skull </b>. The resulting amber zombie is under control of the creating plant. <b>The zombie will seek to bring new victims to the creeper's hungry vines and if the creeper is attacked the amber zombie will defend it </b>. <b>Amber zombies use whatever weapons and armour the victim had at the time of his or her conversion, but the zombie fights as 2HD monster with no spell-using abilities or ability score bonuses </b>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Despite their name, amber zombies are not undead and cannot be turned by a cleric. They are, however, <u>immune to mind-influencing magic just as true zombies are </u>. After 2 months of service the zombie wanders away from the parent plant to find a nice patch of soil in a likely spot, where it dies and a new amber creeping vine sprouts from the corpse.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The only known way to cure an amber zombie is to kill the controlling creeper and cast both a neutralise poison and heal upon the zombie in rapid succession. <b>The victim will be restored to his or her former self but will require a full week of rest for every 4 points (rounded up) of intelligence lost before being able to adventure again </b>.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"I0IQ9ef7ZhLd66iw":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"ca296d54f357069ae8667587c6ce8142ec8d7dbe","sourceId":"JournalEntry.PXPFXhjWfZ13dciN"},"cf":{"id":"temp_7sa1hbclizd","path":"OSRIC-GM#/CF_SEP/Chapter 5: Monsters#/CF_SEP/Other Creatures","color":"#000000"}}}

{"_id":"R4VMuYjz5L3Ifizr","name":"Afterword","content":"<h1>Afterword</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>As is traditional with RPGs, I suppose I should finish the OSRIC rules with a few words of advice for the newer player and, particularly, for the newer GM. At this point, it's traditional to remind players that the GM can change or ignore any rule whatsoever, as he or she sees fit or on a whim, with or without giving a reason - please consider yourself reminded. And the traditional advice to GMs is the same here too: Never follow a rule over a cliff.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Please do follow this advice, it'll improve your game.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Having said that, I can go on to say the things I really wanted to say in the afterword. They are: First, play OSRIC fast. Part of the beauty of this system is, with a little knowledge and practice, you can run a battle between ten player characters with a dozen hirelings and henchmen and a handful of summoned monsters on one side, and thirty ogres with a shaman and two dozen worgs on the other, and you can resolve it in thirty minutes flat. It helps to roll dice in handfuls, but the big things that make that possible are the simplicity of the combat rules and morale. Don't forget morale, it's important - it's for skipping over the boring bits. The moment it becomes obvious to intelligent monsters that they'll lose a fight, they will run or surrender.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>And this brings me to the second thing, which is, please do skip over the boring bits. Fudge things to make them faster. And if they can't be fudged, then the GM and players should share jobs fairly - if the party's using detailed encumbrance rules, then the GM shouldn't have to do all the bean-counting. After all, the GM is busy doing GM-like things, such as drinking the beer that's so vital to his or her concentration or laughing cruelly at the players' latest mistake, and so has no time to do math.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The third thing is, in OSRIC generating a player character is fast. If you die, it's a quick and easy job to roll a new character and get straight back into the action. Which means that dying isn't so much of a pain in the neck as it might be with other systems.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Assume you will lose some player characters from time to time and plan accordingly. Once you're past the first few levels, most players should accumulate a few henchmen who can replace their main character if the main character dies (or is petrified, disintegrated, converted to green slime, swallowed whole by some huge monster, falls into a sphere of annihilation, or...well, OSRIC's a dangerous world, lots of things can happen).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>If you die and fail your resurrection chance, deal with it with good grace. Sure - nobody likes to lose a character, but don't take it too seriously. This is a game. In OSRIC, you aren't entitled to be the hero. You might just get to be the hero, but don't expect it as a right.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>And there's a fourth thing: Make sure everyone 'round the table gets a chance to have their say, but don't tolerate dithering. If your GM asks you, \"What do you do now?\" then you'd better answer at once or expect to lose your opportunity.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The fifth and last thing is, your GM isn't called a \"story-teller\" for a reason. He or she isn't telling you a story with you cast as the protagonist. (If you want that, try one of White Wolf's games.) The GM creates a world - you create a character who wants something. It's up to you to go out and get it. Story is the result of the game, not a process within it.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Have fun!</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>- <i>Stuart Marshall</i></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"modules/osric-compendium/images/FG OSRIC_Page_391_Image_0003.jpg\" height=\"600\" />","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"I0IQ9ef7ZhLd66iw":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"929260f1789834b8f5175477fd359980708e4194","sourceId":"JournalEntry.R4VMuYjz5L3Ifizr","defaultPermission":2},"cf":{"id":"temp_8gjrejiosq","path":"OSRIC-PC#/CF_SEP/Afterword, OSRIC Open License, and OGL#/CF_SEP/Afterword","color":"#000000"}}}

Fighters are trained in the use of weapons and armour, usually beginning their adventuring careers after a stint of training as a town guardsman, soldier, man at arms, bandit, pirate, or mercenary.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Fighters are the backbone of an adventuring party; without them to hold the line, the other members of the party will be overrun before they can bring their own skills to bear. Fighters are the most powerful characters in melee or missile combat, whether on offence or defence. Together with the ranger and paladin, they have the most hit points, and their ability to survive the most brutal battles is therefore unrivalled.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>They also have the best chance \"to hit\" of all the classes, particularly at higher level. They may use any kind of armour, shield, or weapon. Most fighters look forward to the day when their reputations will bring them into the ranks of the lesser nobility, where fighting prowess and armed followers are more important than high-flown bloodlines. It is no small matter to carve a \"freehold out of the wilderness, but to do so is to leave behind a legacy in a world where most fortune-seekers die an unsung death.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A fighter of 9th level or higher who has built a castle and cleared a wide area around it of monsters (at least a 20 mile radius), will attract a body of mercenaries to his or her service, provided that these are paid a fair wage. He or she will also be able to tax each freeholder, at up to the maximum rate of 1 gp per month per resident. Some players may choose to retire a character at this point, satisfied that the character has entered the historical records and legends of the campaign world. Others may choose to view the stronghold merely as the first step toward the pinnacles of mythic power. Such player-held castles and villages provide a higher-level party with a base for adventures, a stronghold against enemies, and possibly the introduction of feudal politics and war into their already-eventful lives.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>The Fighter Character</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Minimum Scores: Str 9, Dex 6, Con 7, Int 3, Wis 6, Cha 6</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Hit Die Type: [[/roll 1d10]] (max 9 hit dice)</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Alignment: Any</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Experience bonus: Strength 16+</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Armour/Shield Permitted: Any</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Weapons Permitted: Any</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Weapon Proficiencies: 4+1 every 2 levels</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Penalty to hit for non-proficiency: -2</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Weapon Specialisation: Optional</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Fighter Class Abilities</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Bonus Attacks: </b>Fighters with melee weapons attack once per round at 1st to 6th levels (1/1 attacks); at 7th to 12th levels, they attack thrice every two rounds (3/2 attacks); and at 13th or higher levels they attack twice per round (2/1 attacks). A partial additional attack (e.g. 3/2 attacks) means that the extra attack is taken on odd-numbered rounds in the combat sequence, hence two attacks on the first round, one on the second, two on the third and one on the fourth, if applicable.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Fighting the Unskilled: </b>When the fighter is attacking creatures with less than a full hit die (i.e. less than [[/roll 1d8]] hit points), the fighter receives one attack for each of his or her levels of experience, e.g. a 4th level fighter attacking goblins would receive 4 attacks per round.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>NB: </b>A fighter exercising multiple attacks departs from the normal initiative procedure.

Spell memorisation requires a minimum rest period of 4 hours, which must be spent in a quiet place without interruption. Once this period has expired, it takes fifteen minutes per level to memorise spells; in other words, a character memorising one 3rd, two 2nd and four 1st level spells would require a further (45+30+30+15+15+15+15=) two hours and forty-five minutes of memorisation time.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Spells, once cast, are lost from the casting character's memory and cannot be reused until the caster memorises them again.

They can be found in any of the evilly-aligned lower planes and will be serving the various demons, devils, evil elemental gods, or any extra-planar creature of dark purpose and evil intent. Their exact origins and home plane are not known; even the mephits themselves do not know for certain. This entry lists the known types of mephits, but dark rumours persist of other types more dangerous than these.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Mephits share various common characteristics. They are all about 5 ft tall, bat-winged, with sharp fangs. Mephits speak their own language shared by all the different types of mephits, their alignment tongue, and usually speak the common tongue of whatever lower plane they happen to call home. Mephits are mischievous and have a malignant sense of humour, finding joy in the pain of others. Mephits love to dress in outlandish clothing, choosing colours and designs that clash and draw attention. They are often found smoking an infernal cigar that gives off an offensive odour. Mephits love to strut about as they smoke, shrieking in shrill voices in their harsh tongue.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Fire Mephit: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</b>These creatures are a dull red colour with spots of black on the dorsal surfaces and a slightly lighter red on the ventral surface. <b>Fire mephits are wreathed with tiny wisps of flame and touching one bare-handed will cause 1 point of damage </b>. <b>In combat mephits attack with two claws and a breath weapon </b>. <b>Though damage for claw attacks is listed as [[/roll 1d3]] points apiece, an additional 1 point of heat damage is also inflicted upon non fire- </b><b><u>resistant opponents for a total of 2 </u></b><b>-4 points of damage per claw </b>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The fire mephit's breath weapon has two modes: a jet of flame 15 ft long and 1 in wide, or a blanket of flame 5 ft square. <b>The jet is directed against a single target and always hits, causing [[/roll 1d8+1]] hp; </b><u>a saving throw vs breath weapons is allowed for half damage. </u><b>The blanket of flame causes 4 points of damage to each victim in the area of effect, </b><u>no saving throw allowed.</u></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Fire mephits also have spell-like abilities </b>and are able to cast <b><i>magic missile </i></b>(two missiles) and <b><i>heat metal </i></b>once each per day.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>The fire mephit may also gate in a mephit ally, </b>type determined randomly, once per hour with a 33% chance of success.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Lava Mephit: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</b>These mephits are red in colour and sweat droplets of molten lava.

Breaking through the ice with a melee weapon causes 2 hit points of damage from ice shards per inch of thickness, and can be broken out at a rate of 10-ft per round. </b>Normal fire has no measurable effect upon the wall, but <u>magical fire will melt through it in one round. </u>If the wall is destroyed by fire in a single round, <b>it will cause a massive cloud of water vapour to form and linger for a full turn, obscuring vision by 50%.</b></p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"I0IQ9ef7ZhLd66iw":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"b1d4506be913ce2adbcf8b48231c6093a10486b7","sourceId":"JournalEntry.VzZsGbz3RWi9fbcL","defaultPermission":2},"cf":{"id":"temp_jkazjmgsg","path":"OSRIC-PC#/CF_SEP/Chapter 2: Spells#/CF_SEP/Magic User Spells","color":"#000000"}}}
{"_id":"W011hHdIV1NMnfM0","name":"Illusionist","content":"<h1>Illusionist</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Illusionists are practitioners of phantasmal magic, a type of spell casting that influences the minds and senses of other beings, and at higher levels becomes intertwined with the shadow-realities beyond the Prime Material Plane. They are often classed with magic users, since phantasmal magic operates in the same manner as arcane spells - indeed, some sages state that it represents a different means of tapping into the same source. Illusionists are dependent upon their spell books, and can only normally cast spells they have learned from these books (exception: spells may be cast from illusionist scrolls). Acquisition of new spells is difficult and demanding, and must normally be accomplished through adventuring, although illusionists will automatically receive one new spell of the highest spell level that he or she may cast upon completing training after acquiring a new level of experience. They are limited by their intelligence in what spells they can learn according to the same table as provided under magic users.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>At 10th level, an illusionist may establish a stronghold, usually a tower or small keep, as a fighter does.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>The Illusionist Character</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Minimum Scores: Str 6, Dex 16, Int 15, Wis 6, Cha 6</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Hit Die Type: [[/roll 1d4]] (max 10)</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Alignment: Any</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Experience bonus: None</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Armour/Shield Permitted: None</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Weapons Permitted: Dagger, dart, oil, staff</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Weapon Proficiencies: 1+1 per 5 levels</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Penalty to hit for non-proficiency: -5</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Weapon Specialisation: N/A</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Illusionist Class Abilities</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Spell casting: </b>Illusionists may memorise and cast phantasmal spells in accordance with the tables provided below.

{"_id":"WjStL5ecyKgsZcRg","name":"Money","content":"<h1>Money</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>In OSRIC, coins are heavy. Ten coins weigh one lbs. They are also of primary importance when keeping track of character experience, since gold the party recovers is converted to experience at the rate of 1gp = 1xp. (The GM may well wish to reduce the experience point award for gold if large amounts are gained for relatively small risk.) OSRIC prices normally far exceed prices as they were in the real mediæval world. Gold is plentiful and hence of relatively little value. The purpose of this is to allow GMs to place the kinds of treasure mentioned in works of fantasy literature - huge piles of gold, enormous gems and pieces of beautiful jewellery - without destroying the fantasy economy of his or her game.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A fundamental, driving assumption of OSRIC-compatible games is that the player characters are, at least partially, motivated by a desire (or need) for wealth. This need not necessarily be for reasons of greed; a cleric or paladin character, for example, could be driven to acquire money to donate to the poor, or to enable his or her superiors to construct a new church. However this is managed, the mechanics of the game specifically reward the acquisition of money, and so successful players will tend to find an awful lot of it!</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Shrewd GMs will usually use all the tools at their disposal to ensure that while a lot of money flows through the players' hands, other pressures will keep their expenses high.

( <b><i>Note that the resulting changes don't show for rolls made outside of the combat tracker, only inside of it </i></b>- if you make \"practice rolls\" outside of the tracker these effects won't observably modify the rolls.)</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>TO-HIT MODIFYING EFFECTS:</u>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>To equalize combat rolls, use the following effect in the \"Effect Features\" portion of the NPC character sheet (below most of the basic character info on the Main (or cover) tab.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>ATK:\"x\"</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>so for our wizard above, I'd want their to hit rolls treated as six worse than were rolled, since the engine will determine hits against a baseline of \"11\". So I'd add an effect of minus six (-6), like so:</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>ATK:-6</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Now if our wizard rolls a natural (or modified) \"17\", the engine will reduce that to an \"11\" and judge it successfully hits an AC of 0 (against its hard-coded comparison value of \"11\" hitting AC 0 for a 5HD creature).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>ATTACK VALUES FOR 0-LEVEL AND NPCs HAVING HIGH HIT DICE:</u>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>For calculating the appropriate combat matrix, the 1E extension doesn't recognize hit dice greater than 16, or less than \"1-1\" (or, \"one hit die minus one hit point\"); i.e., having combat ability that is worse than a goblin's.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>If you input values exceeding 16 or less than 1-1 (such as \"0\" or \"20\") then the attack matrix fuzzes out to show 20s across the range of all dice results. But if the GM desires, it is still possible to automate improved or reduced combat results for high- and low-HD creatures by using the modifier discussed above.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>For creatures having attack values less than a goblin, such as most normal 0-level humans, insert \"1-1\" into the hit dice field so that the attack matrix table is functioning; then insert an \"ATK: -1\" (or -2, etc.). This should cover such things as non-adventuring humans.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>For high hit dice NPCs, input 16 into the hit dice field. You can still put the correct amount into the hit points field - i.e., a creature can show hit dice of 16 while having a hit point range of [[/roll 20d8]] in the field to the right of the hit point box. Then give the NPC the \"ATK: X\" modifier you desire.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>SAVE MODIFYING EFFECTS:</u>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>All classed NPC templates provided to the GM have correct saving throw values set for them; taking into consideration such variances as dwarf bonuses at a minimum dwarf constitution, \"best-of\" selections for multiclassed characters, etc.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>NOTE THAT CHANGING HIT DICE (even accidentally deleting a previous number) RESETS SAVING THROW VALUES TO THE BASELINE FOR A FIGHTER CHARACTER OF THE UPDATED HIT DICE.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>I've done this accidentally done this, often, while making these modules <b>.</b></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>I still prefer setting values directly, even at risk of reset. However, a GM can instead leave the base saving throw values and enter modifiers similar to the ATK modifiers above. This insures an accidental delete or write-over doesn't require re-inputting all the save fields individually.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Use this template to insert a similar global effect modifying saving throw rolls, that works similarly to the effect described above:</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>POISON: ;PARALYZATION: ;DEATH: ;ROD: ;STAFF: ;WAND: ;PETRIFICATION: ;POLYMORPH: ;BREATH: ;SPELL:</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>So for our 5th level wizard, I don't want him to save as a 5HD monster (which is the same as a 5th level fighter - <i>which also means NPC fighters will never need saving throw modifiers! </i>), because there are variances in every category.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Paralyzation/Poison/Death </b>: wizard (14); monster (11)</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Rod/Staff/Wand </b>: wizard (11); monster (13)</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Petrification/Polymorph </b>: wizard (13); monster (12)</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Breath Weapon </b>: wizard (15); monster (13)</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Spell </b>: wizard (12); monster (14)</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>so I'd input the following specific modifiers:</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>POISON:-3;PARALYZATION:-3;DEATH:-3;ROD:2;STAFF:2;WAND:2;PETRIFICATION:-1;POLYMORPH:-1;BREATH:-2;SPELL:2</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>And now a 5th level NPC wizard will save \"correctly\".</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>If there is no difference for a particular save category </u>(for example, there often isn't for mid-level clerics against a medium hit dice monster's rods/wands/staff save) you can either enter \"0\" (sans quote marks) for the category(-ies), or just delete the relevant category(-ies) in the global effect for that NPC sheet. I prefer to just enter zeroes as it's faster.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>SURPRISE:</u>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>One quick note - the 2E system of adding dexterity adjustments to a rolled surprise value is also hard coded, and can return a green \"you're not surprised\" result when a natural \"2\" is rolled by a high DEX character. in OSRIC dexterity adjustments don't modify the die result, but there are several ways to handle it:</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>1. Don't use the FG surprise mechanic; just roll a [[/roll 1d6]] in chat</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>2. if using the mechanic simply ignore the \"green/good\" visual, instead focusing on the natural \"2\" FG indicates was rolled, and run surprise.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>3. If no dexterity adjustments apply the FG mechanic works perfectly fine. So another work around is to have an average DEX character designated to roll surprise for the group, if there aren't any other mitigating circumstances - such as a ranger character with a \"1\" surprise value, who should roll instead (provided they don't have a high enough DEX to make the mechanic inaccurate).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Also, note that variations from a surprise value of \"2\", or other such modifiers, must be entered manually by clicking the \"Combat\" gear in the Actions tab - such as that of the aforementioned ranger. There you can change the default surprise value from \"2\" to \"1\", or imput a temporary mod for drunkeness, etc., if it will last long enough that an entry is deemed more convenient than ad hoc adjustments each time it is rolled.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Variant Monsters and Tribal Spell Casters</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>One aspect of OSRIC which should make it much easier for a GM to provide a dynamic play environment is the detailing of all variants discussed under a base monster entry. If a description says a monster type has sub-chiefs or war-band leaders which differ from the base monster type, these are provided instead of requiring a beleaguered GM to either make these on the fly, or forego the verisimilitude such variance provides.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>However, the base monster description remains the location of any tables or embedded NPCs relating to that monster as a type - these aren't replicated in variants, to save space. So always look to the main/base monster entry for reference information for that monster, even in the rare situation a base version of that monster isn't present.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Tribal spell casters are also provided, and embedded in the base monster entries for easy access. NOTE: they each have a basic spell selection so they can be used on the fly as needed, but the \"full\" (they're very abridged lists) of spells available to shaman and witch doctors are given in the \"Tribal Spell Casters\" story entry, for a GM's use in preparing encounters.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>In making tribal spell caster NPCs, the optional OSRIC rule allowing them extra hit points and combat bonuses for high \"levels\" of spellcasting is used. If you don't wish this optional rule to apply you can copy and modify the templates.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Cursed Items</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>One aspect I plan to continue working on is the cursed item tables - I'm not quite happy with how they pull results at the moment, but this is due to FG primarily centering on delivering \"completed\" content.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>In OSRIC there are some few specific cursed items, but the tables mostly deliver results with some guidelines directing you as GM to make a unique items along the guidelines given.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>In any event, currently, be aware that seeminly-odd results in magic item random rolls should be checked to see if a cursed item was called for. It it was, and you have time, review the cursed item text for guidelines about how to insert a cursed item of your own creation. Or you can substitute one of the limited number of specific cursed items included in OSRIC (or just ignore and re-roll for a non-cursed item, if seeking a table result in the middle of play).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Encounter Tables</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>OUTDOOR ENCOUNTERS</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Most \"outdoor\" encounter tables do not provide a FG encounter data type - the output a story entry. This is because in OSRIC an outdoor random encounter might be the monster stumbling upon the PCs while out and about, or it might be the PCs stumbling upon where the monster lives (its \"lair\"). The either/or aspect requires determination, and the story delivered has a table embedded giving that information plus the number appearing. Generate this information and drop the NPC type into a fresh encounter.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The lair designation is also very important because a monster encountered randomly in-lair may have treasure somewhere inside if defeated! Whereas if encountered away from its lair it more likely has nothing, or perhaps some magic items it owns which it can carry and use in combat if applicable. The ability to track a monster's trail back to its lair and collect treasure from it is one reason why a ranger is very valuable to a party of PCs...</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Each monster NPC Details tab also has an embedded table for its treasure type - if it keeps treasure - to make it easy for a GM to generate all the information necessary to support exploring/hex-crawling on the fly.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>DUNGEON/URBAN ENCOUNTERS</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Unlike outdoor encounters, random dungeon and urban encounters are always assumed to be \"away from lair\". So these default to providing an FG encounter entry for immediate use in uploading to the combat tracker.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>NOTABLE EXCEPTION - PILGRIMS, CARAVANS, AND NPC ADVENTURING PARTIES</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>These three groups are complex - they each come with multiple leveled NPCs and often large numbers of non-leveled NPCs. The leveled NPCs are very likely to have magical items for use should the PCs desire to enter into politics by other means with them.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>They shouldn't be created \"on-the-fly\". However, a handy generator is provided for each of these types to take the vast majority of routine table rolling and automate it. The GM should be able to take the output results and apply their individual taste and creativity to finalize memerable and fun-to-play encounters showcasing the game world's depth. Caravans may have needed wares and be willing to restock the party while they're on the road; pilgrimages and carvans may offer the safety of numbers to parties traveling in the same direction; NPC parties offer peer rivals (or allies) and remind players that others seek the same sorts of adventure; not all hooks remain available forever.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>And of course - all of these often carry riches and magic otherwise only available in a dragon's lair. An evil pilgrimage could represent quite a haul. Are the players willing to gamble fighting peer apex predators such as themselves? Such is the thing memories are made of.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>However, all of this complexity translates to enormous sized files for each of these. Several nearly--completed versions of these NPC types - awaiting only your creative touches and personalization - are provided as story entries (necessary to convey all the information pertaining to them). As you use the GM's reference module(s) to generate more to replace those used, it is <b><u>HIGHLY </u></b>recommended you export them into their own data modules to bring into the campaign as needed.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Each of the three types are handled differently when the random encounter tables call upon them, as follows:</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Caravans and Pilgrims</u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Outdoor: </b>one of the story entries included on the table(s) \"six ready-to-use caravans/pilgrimages\", both housed in the GM's Reference module for monsters and encounters, will be provided to you. If combat results drag the NPC character sheets to an encounter you generate and upload to the combat tracker.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Urban: </b>you will get an encounter with individual pilgrim or merchant (and possibly bodyguards) NPCS included in the urban encounters module. However, depending upon how play develops you may want to bring up the monsters and encounters module to roll on the \"ready-to-use\" table(s) and assign them to a caravan or pilgrimage in your world - perhaps the players wish to negotiate joint travel with them, for instance, and you need to know where they're heading. (Or you could just make this up on the fly, too.)</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Dungeon: </b>N/A unless created by the GM</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>NPC Adventuring Parties</u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Each NPC story entry comes embedded with a dedicated (empty) encounter and parcel, for quick use if combat erupts.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Outdoor: </b>one of the story entries included on the table \"Random Wilderness Encounter - NPC Parties\" table, housed in the GM's Reference module for monsters and encounters, will be provided to you along with a designation of the NPC's party's current disposition (searchers, escapees, runners, etc.).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Urban: </b>N/A for encounters-with-a-party, but the urban encounter tables are loaded with classed NPC encounters. While many of them would be with residents, the GM may wish to deem some of these classed NPCs as members of adventuring parties they have based in that location, or are just passing through but have members which fit the race/class of the randomly encountered classed NPC.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Dungeon: </b>As all NPC adventuring party entries are stories, and the dungeon random encounter matrixes serve up encounter entries, you will receive a encounter containing an empty placeholder NPC whose name directs you to roll on a given table of NPC party stories.

{"_id":"YssusLPi2dvzd0Qe","name":"Thief","content":"<h1>Thief</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Thieves sneak furtively in the shadowed alleyways of cities, living by their wits. They are often members of the criminal underclass, usually trained by a thieves' guild in the arts of burglary and stealth. It is not uncommon for a thief to seek out the great rewards that can be gained from the adventuring life, especially when circumstances require lying low for a while.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Most thieves come from the teeming masses of a large city, wherein a thieves' guild is often the only source of justice and exercises as much power as the city's legitimate government. Of course, not all thieves are members of a guild. Some are freelancers, evading both the authorities and the guild, living on the edge of the knife. Some are even found working on the side of the law; agents or spies who use their skills in more accepted (though equally shadowy) pursuits. A thief character must be of any neutral or evil alignment. Neutral good thieves are permitted because of the neutral component of their alignment.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Sensible adventuring parties will almost always include a thief, for the skills of such a character are invaluable in reaching inaccessible places via climb walls, pick locks, and so on. In addition, dungeons frequently contain traps which must be located and disarmed, and the thief's cunning and stealth conspire to make him or her very useful in a scouting role.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Thieves in OSRIC are modelled on characters of fiction and legend, particularly characters from the works of Fritz Leiber and Jack Vance. Leiber's \"Lankhmar\" series is highly recommended, particularly for its description of the operation of a typical thieves' guild; but the high-level thief's ability to read (or misread) magic scrolls is a nod to Vance's Cugel.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>The Thief Character</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Minimum Scores: Str 6, Dex 9, Con 6, Int 6, Cha 6</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Hit Die Type: [[/roll 1d6]]</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Initial Hit Die: 1</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Alignment: Any neutral or any evil</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Experience bonus: Dex 16+</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Armour/Shield Permitted: Leather or studded leather only, no shields</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Weapons Permitted: Club, dagger, dart, oil, sling, single-handed swords (except bastard swords)</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Weapon Proficiencies: 2+1 every 4 levels</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Penalty to hit for non-proficiency: -3</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Weapon Specialisation: N/A</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Thief Class Abilities</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Backstab: </b>If the thief can approach his or her target unobserved and strike with a melee weapon, the attack is made at +4 to hit. Damage from a backstab is doubled or trebled if the thief is of 5th level or higher. Thieves of 9th level or higher do quadruple damage, while those of 13th or greater level quintuple the number shown on the die. Damage modifiers (such as those pertaining to strength or magic) are not multiplied from a backstab.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Climb: </b>Climbing represents a thief's ability to scale sheer walls and surfaces, cling to ceilings, and perform other feats of climbing that would normally be impossible. Climbing checks must ordinarily be repeated for every ten ft of climbing. Non-thieves cannot climb walls, cliffs, or any vertical surface without the use of a rope or magic, making the presence of a thief vital to many adventuring parties.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Find Traps: </b>This ability represents the thief's minute visual inspection of a new area for tiny telltale signs that something of interest or danger may be concealed nearby. It requires a full turn (10 minutes) to accomplish.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Hide in Shadows: </b>Some shadow must be present for this ability to be used, but if the check is successful the thief is effectively invisible until he makes an attack or moves from the shadows. The ability can also be used to blend in with a crowd of people rather than disappear into shadows.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Move Quietly: </b>Use of this skill allows the thief to move with preternatural silence even over surfaces such as squeaky floors.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Open Locks/Disarm Traps: </b>Opening locks and disarming traps (without springing them) is a skill unique to thieves, which cannot be successfully attempted by members of other classes. A thief can also set traps (with the same chance as to disarm).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Pick Pockets: </b>If the thief's pick pockets check fails by 20% or more, then his or her attempt has been discovered and the intended victim will almost always take hostile action.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Read Languages: </b>The thief may attempt to read languages and ciphers of a non-magical nature only.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Thieves' Cant: </b>Thieves have their own language.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Advanced Abilities</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Read Scrolls (10th): </b>When a thief reaches 10th level, he or she has become versed enough in training to cast spells from an arcane or phantasmal scroll (magic user or illusionist). However, this casting is not always successful. The thief should roll against his or her intelligence as a magic user or illusionist does, and if the score shown on the die is insufficient for the thief to cast the spell, then the casting will fail, possibly (at the GM's option) having some entirely unexpected effect.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Thief Level

{"_id":"Z5BV3tGxkRyO0gfF","name":"Explanatory Notes and Definitions of Terms","content":"<h1>Explanatory Notes and Definitions of Terms</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The authors envisage that OSRIC will be used primarily by people who are already familiar with 1e-compatible systems, so we have not burdened the following text with long passages of explanation concerning matters probably already familiar to our target audience. Nevertheless, we cannot assume that everyone who uses OSRIC will already be familiar with every term that we use, so we have provided brief explanations of some of the terminology here.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Readers who are familiar with 1e-compatible systems will probably not need to refer to this section and should skip on ahead to the next.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Attribute: </b>(also called: Ability Score; Characteristic) - defined in Chapter 1 as; \"...represented in the game by six 'ability scores'.\" These abilities are Strength (Str), Dexterity (Dex), Constitution (Con), Intelligence (Int), Wisdom (Wis), and Charisma (Cha)...\"</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Character: </b>A character is an individual featuring in the game. Each player controls one character, save the GM, who controls all the characters not controlled by a player.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Class: </b>Characters in OSRIC-compatible games frequently have special skills and talents. (This is always the case with PCs.) These special skills and talents are summarised by describing the individual as a member of a particular character class - \"class\" for short. See Chapter 1 for a detailed explanation of character classes.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Demi-human: </b>Demi-humans are human-like creatures generally of good alignment or disposed towards humankind. They include elves, dwarfs, gnomes, halflings, and other similar creatures.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Dice and Notation: </b>Game and hobby stores often sell dice with varying numbers of sides. If there is no such game or hobby store near you, you can also order them from distributors such as Chessex http://www.chessex.com/. You will need a set of such dice in order to play OSRIC.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The abbreviation \"d\" means \"die\" or \"dice\", always printed in conjunction with a subsequent number indicating the number of sides (hence, a traditional cube-shaped dice with six sides is called a [[/roll 1d6]]). A number appearing before the \"d\" indicates how many dice are to be rolled (and if there is no number, it should be assumed to be 1) - hence, \"[[/roll 3d8]]\" means \"roll three eight-sided dice and sum the total.\"</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>You will need at least one [[/roll 1d4]], [[/roll 1d6]], [[/roll 1d8]], [[/roll 1d10]], [[/roll 1d12]] and [[/roll 1d20]] to play OSRIC, and the authors recommend at least one complete set per player. The special notation \"d%\" means \"roll [[/roll 2d10]] and treat the first number as tens and the second number as units\", thus generating a random number from 1 to 100. (If both dice show \"0\", this is interpreted as a roll of \"100\".)</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Experience bonus: </b>Single-classed characters may receive an experience bonus for having a high attribute; see the character class description for details. Where an experience bonus for a high attribute is mentioned, this means that at the GM's discretion, any earned experience may be multiplied by up to 1.1.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>GM: </b>The Game Master (\"GM\") does not normally have a particular character of his or her own. Instead, he or she is responsible for controlling the remainder of the game universe apart from the player characters. The GM has ultimate power over the game, including the ability to waive or rewrite the rules, and also controls all the Non-Player Characters (\"NPCs\" - see below) in the game universe. The GM's job is to ensure that the game is entertaining, yet difficult and demanding, for the players.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Humanoid: </b>Humanoids are human-like creatures generally of evil alignment or ill-disposed towards humankind, for example, orcs, goblins or hobgoblins.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Level: </b>This term has a wide variety of meanings in OSRIC-compatible games. It can refer to a character's progression on his or her experience chart, to a monster's power relative to character level, to the relative power of a spell, or to a particular depth into a dungeon.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Monster: </b>\"Monster\" is sometimes used interchangeably with \"NPC\" - thus, a wandering \"monster\" table might include helpful creatures and humans or humanoids. Generally, \"NPC\" means a human, demi-human or humanoid character while \"monster\" could mean any creature the players might encounter.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Player: </b>In an OSRIC-compatible game, one participant must be the Game Master (see below). All the others are referred to as \"players\". This term is sometimes used to distinguish between a player and his or her character.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>\"PC\" and \"NPC\": </b>\"PC\" is an abbreviation for \"Player Character\" and refers to a character controlled by a player. \"NPC\" is an abbreviation for \"Non-Player Character\" and refers to a character controlled by the GM.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Prime Requisite: </b>The Prime Requisites for a character class are those Attributes which affect its experience point bonus, e.g. strength for fighters, intelligence for magic users, and so on. Classes such as assassin which have no experience point bonus use the most logical attribute. (In the case of assassins, this would be dexterity.)</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Race: </b>This refers to a character's species (rather than his or her ethnic origin, which is irrelevant to OSRIC-compatible games except in very unusual circumstances). OSRIC-compatible games feature a wide variety of non-human races, some of which (such as elves or dwarfs) can be PCs, but the majority of which (such as dragons) are confined to NPCs only. See Chapter 1 for a detailed description of the various nonhuman PC races.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>To Hit and Saving Throw Tables: </b>The numbers indicated on the \"to hit\" and saving throw tables are the scores required (or greater) on a [[/roll 1d20]] for the creature to hit its target or save against an attack of the type indicated.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Weapon Proficiencies: </b>Each character class may only have a certain number of \"Weapons of Proficiency\" at first level. All classes gain additional proficiencies at regular intervals. The weapon proficiencies for each specific class are described in the rules entry pertaining to that class.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Weapon of Proficiency must be an individual weapon type (e.g. \"Longsword\" rather than \"Sword\"). If a character is fighting with a weapon with which he or she is not proficient, the Non-Proficiency Penalty is applied to his or her \"to hit\" rolls.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"I0IQ9ef7ZhLd66iw":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"f92f26c9b72c0bb9506cb14261b1a44f5a747851","sourceId":"JournalEntry.Z5BV3tGxkRyO0gfF","defaultPermission":2},"cf":{"id":"temp_df0epgupt6c","path":"OSRIC-PC#/CF_SEP/OSRIC#/CF_SEP/Explanatory Notes and Definitions of Terms","color":"#000000"}}}

They are modelled on such characters of fiction as Aragorn and Robin Hood and are particularly expert in wilderness situations. Rangers are defenders of the poor and serve to protect civilisation from the evil forces that lurk beyond civilised lands.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Rangers must abide by certain limitations, in the same fashion as paladins:</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>First, the ranger must always remain of good alignment (lawful, neutral or chaotic). Any deliberate change in the ranger's alignment away from good will result in the character becoming a mere fighter, with 8-sided hit dice, never able to regain ranger-hood. An unintentional change will transform the character into a fighter as above, but in this case, with sufficient questing and atonement, the ranger may be permitted to recover his or her status. The GM will determine the precise details of this process according to the situation.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Second, rangers may not employ mercenaries or servants until they reach 8th level or higher. Even once permitted, a ranger may not employ any mercenary or servant who he or she suspects (or ought to suspect) is not of good alignment.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Third, a maximum of three rangers may travel or operate together at any one time.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Fourth, rangers travel light and may not keep any more treasure than they can lift (including any amount the ranger can carry on his or her steed, if any).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>The Ranger Character</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Minimum Scores: Str 13, Dex 6, Con 14, Int 13, Wis 14, Cha 6</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Hit Die Type: [[/roll 1d8]] (max 11 at 10th level)</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Initial Hit Die: 2*</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Alignment: Any good</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Experience bonus: Str, Int, and Wis 16+</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Armour/Shield Permitted: Any</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Weapons Permitted: Any</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Weapon Proficiencies: 3+1 every 2</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Penalty \"to hit\" for non-proficiency: -2</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Weapon Specialisation: Optional rule - as fighter</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>* Rangers are different from fighters and paladins in terms of hit points.

This is not a matter in which generic tables would be helpful - a campaign set in a Norse winterland would need quite different tables to one set in a Caribbean archipelago - so no weather-generation rules are provided here.

The description of the item as \"silver\", \"gold\", etc. is a guideline and the GM should interpret it to represent a broad category of value rather than its literal composition. </b>A gold item could actually be high-quality filigree silver, ivory, or even enamelled bronze of superb workmanship. \"Exceptional\" quality may mean that the item is fashioned of platinum, mithril or some other extremely rare and valuable substance, or it may simply mean a very fine example of gem-encrusted gold.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The appraisal of jewellery is a complex and difficult skill. Gnomes frequently have the best eye for these matters, although thieves, assassins and dwarfs may also be able to hazard a guess. The GM should allow a possibility (depending on the circumstances) that a character may seriously underestimate or overestimate an object's value.

{"_id":"eX5Srq0T8mc2o0NE","name":"Poison, Disease and Insanity","content":"<h1>Poison, Disease and Insanity</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Poisons commonly encountered in OSRIC-compatible games include animal venoms (such as snake and spider bites), vegetable toxins (often used to coat poison needles or similar devices on traps), and essentially magical poisons such as clouds of poisonous gas. Generally, when a player character ingests or inhales the poison, or it otherwise enters his or her bloodstream, he or she must roll a saving throw against poison (sometimes with a modifier - up to +2 for a relatively weak toxin such as that of a Large Spider, down to -4 for a particularly lethal one). If the saving throw is failed, the character dies.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>In practice death from such cases is not instantaneous, although the character is typically incapacitated immediately. There is time for slow poison or neutralise poison to be cast on the character, if this is done reasonably soon (say, within about 15 minutes depending on the strength of the venom or toxin involved).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>If the character dies as a result of poison, the poison must somehow be flushed from his or her bloodstream before any kind of raise dead or resurrection can succeed.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The general rule is that characters cannot employ poisons as\" easily as monsters. Venom taken from a creature's poison glands will, for game purposes, typically begin to lose effectiveness immediately and have become completely denatured within a few hours. Some characters - often assassins - may learn how to create vegetable-based toxins that can last longer if kept in the correct way, but lethal toxins will still need to be handled with great care. The GM should determine whether any given activity involving the poison runs a risk of the handler receiving a tiny cut, scratch or nick (requiring an immediate poison save). Certain good aligned character classes, such as paladins, may not use poison and will object to their companions using it.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Finally, some creatures - particularly powerful ones such as dragons - are so large, and their body chemistries are so different, that poisons will not normally work against them.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The principle is that poisons in the hands of player characters change the balance of the game in undesirable ways, so players should be discouraged from using them.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Diseases in OSRIC-compatible games often come from monsters, such as mummies or giant rats, in which case the chance of disease and its effects are described in the relevant creature text. There are a few other instances where disease may be contracted that are explained here.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>First, plagues (such as the mediæval bubonic plague or Black Death) may occasionally spread across the countryside. A character who comes into contact with plague will need to save against poison to avoid succumbing him- or herself. If the character saves, any future saving throws against the same disease will be made at +4. If he or she fails, then after an incubation period of [[/roll 2d8]] days, he or she will suffer a penalty of -[[/roll 1d6]] on all characteristics and against all die rolls for the course of the disease, which lasts a further [[/roll 2d8]] days. If either of the dice show an \"8\" then the character dies at the end of this period, otherwise he or she recovers at the rate of 1 point less each day until cured. Further saving throws against the same disease will be made at +4.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Second, certain wounds can become infected. This applies where the GM feels it appropriate, but generally where a character with an open wound engages in high-risk activity such as exploring a sewer, a saving throw versus poison should be required, or else the character will become infected. The effects of infection in game terms are the same as plague, except that the onset time is measured in hours rather than days.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"modules/osric-compendium/images/000.003 how2play3.jpg\" height=\"600\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Insanity is possible as a result of certain spells or monster attacks.

Their magic is rooted in the mystical oneness of nature, and they have particular power over fire, stone, and weather, as well as over plant and animal life.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Some druids pay homage to particular nature gods (some of these quite savage), while others eschew all deities and commune directly with the spiritual power of nature.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Rather than using a holy symbol as clerics do, druids require mistletoe, holly, or (if neither can be found) oak leaves to cast their spells, and one of these is a required component for all druidic spells unless a druidic spell has no material component specified in the spell description.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The druid must harvest these materials by the light of a full moon, or the darkness of a new moon, in order for the component to work with full efficacy. If mistletoe or holly is not gathered by the druid's hand at the proper time, the druid's spells will have only half the normal effect. Oak leaves always produce spells of half power, and if they are not harvested properly, oak leaves will permit spells of only one-quarter power.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Player character druids must be neutral, although druids of differing alignments may be found as non-player characters in some GMs' campaigns.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Druids receive bonus spells for high wisdom, just as clerics do. See the table provided under \"Cleric\" for details.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>There can only be a certain number of high-level druids in the world. The limits are: 12th level druid (High Druid) - no more than 3 in the world at any one time; 13th level druid (Archdruid) - no more than 2 in the world at any given time, 14th level druid (Supreme Druid) - no more than a single Supreme Druid can exist.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>If a druid receives so many experience points that he or she is eligible to increase to these levels, but all the vacant slots are already filled, then he or she must create a vacancy. This is done by issuing a formal challenge to the druid in question, following which the two characters must compete in a contest of some kind - often, but not necessarily, a duel.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The loser of the contest goes down to the next lowest level (losing all experience down to the very minimum to qualify for the new level). This may, in turn, result in a further contest if the preceding level is also fully occupied.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>The Druid Character</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Minimum Scores: Str 6, Dex 6, Con 6, Int 6, Wis 12, Cha 15</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Hit Die Type: [[/roll 1d8]] (max 14)</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Alignment: Neutral only</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Experience bonus: Wisdom and Charisma 16+</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Armour/Shield Permitted: Leather only, wooden shields only</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Weapons Permitted: Club, dagger, dart, hammer, oil, scimitar, sling, spear, staff</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Weapon Proficiencies: 2+1 every 3 levels</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Penalty to hit for non-proficiency: -4</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Weapon Specialisation: N/A</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Druid Class Abilities</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Druids' Cant: </b>All druids speak a secret language called the druids' cant.

It is more difficult to find individuals willing to take service for longer than a few days, especially if considerable travel is involved. If a lengthy term of service is proposed, it is likely that only one in every six such hirelings will agree, though the offer of additional monies may increase the probability of acceptance.

Determine Surprise: </b>If a group of combatants is surprised, its members are basically caught flat-footed and unable to act during the first few seconds of a battle.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Surprise is checked only once per combat, at the beginning of an encounter. Each side rolls a [[/roll 1d6]]. If the result is a 1, the group is surprised for one segment. If the result is a 2, the group is surprised for two segments. If the result is a 3-6, the group is not surprised. In some cases, monsters or particular character classes may have special rules for surprise (e.g. some monsters cannot be surprised, others are stealthy enough that the party may be surprised on a roll of higher than 2). If a party of adventurers has alerted monsters to its presence (by hammering away at a door for a round or two, for example), the monsters will not need to make a surprise roll at all; however, merely being alert to the possibility of danger is not enough to avoid making a surprise roll. If neither of the opposing forces is surprised, play moves on to the regular combat round, described below.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>If one side is surprised while another is not, the unsurprised party may act for a number of \"surprise\" segments. For example, if the party rolls a 1 and the monsters roll a 2, the party is surprised for one segment, the monsters are surprised for two segments, and thus the party has one surprise segment in which to act. If the party rolls a 2 and the monsters roll a 5, the party is surprised for 2 segments and the monsters (who, having rolled a 5 were not surprised at all) have both of those 2 surprise segments in which to act. Actions that would normally happen over the course of a round may be completed in one surprise segment: talking, attacking, charging, closing to melee, beginning a spell, etc., provided that it is possible for the action to take place during a single segment. In other words, a character cannot make a minute-long speech during that six seconds, nor can a spell be fully cast unless it is a one-segment spell.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A character's surprise bonus (see \"Dexterity\") acts to negate surprise segments if the character is surprised (or to create them, if the number is a penalty). Thus, a character with a +2 surprise bonus whose side rolled a 2 for surprise (normally a situation in which the character would be surprised for two segments) is not surprised. This can lead to a situation in which a party of adventurers is surprised with the exception of one member. For example, if the monsters rolled a 1, the party rolled a 2, and one party member had a +2 surprise bonus, the situation will resolve as follows:</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>The party member is not surprised at all, because two segments of surprise are negated by his +2 bonus.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>The monsters are surprised for one segment, so the unsurprised party member may act during that first surprise segment.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>In the second surprise segment, the monsters are no longer surprised, but the rest of the party is still surprised (having rolled a 2), so both the monsters and the one unsurprised character can all take action during the second surprise segment.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Dexterity cannot create surprise, only alter the number of segments for which surprise lasts.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>If a monster surprises on more than a 2 in 6 (some monster descriptions may contain text such as \"surprises on 1-3\"), it is possible for the monster to gain more than two segments of surprise. Against a monster that surprises on 1-3, if the party rolls a 3 and the monster is not surprised, the monster would have three surprise segments in which to act.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>2. Declare Spells and General Actions: </b>Before the two sides roll initiative, spell casters must state what spells (if any) they will be casting in that round. As the round proceeds, the spell caster may elect not to cast the spell, but may not substitute another action. This is simply because the mental preparations for casting a spell are so arduous that the caster cannot switch focus quickly enough to change actions. Non-spell casters should also tell the GM, in general terms, what they will be doing: \"attacking with a sword,\" \"using my bow,\" \"climbing the wall,\" etc.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Before the players do this, the GM should already have formed a similar outline of the monsters' strategy; the GM should not base the monsters' actions on what he or she already knows the players will be doing.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>3. Determine Initiative: </b>After any surprise segments are resolved and spell casting is declared, the first combat round begins. At the beginning of a combat round, each side rolls initiative on a [[/roll 1d6]]. The roll represents the six second segment of the round in which the OTHER group will be able to act; hence, the higher roll is the better roll (as the other party will act later). If the party rolls a 6 for initiative, and the monsters roll a 1, this means that the party will be acting in segment 1, and the monsters will not act until the sixth segment of the 10-segment round. Since a combat round is 10 segments long, and the initiative roll only covers the first six segments of the round, there are four remaining segments in the round after the two sides have already taken their actions: these remaining four segments are still important because spells may take effect during this time, and some combatants might \"hold\" (choose to delay) their actions, waiting to act until these later segments.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The dexterity bonus for surprise is not added to an individual's initiative for melee attacks, but if a character has a missile weapon in hand, he or she applies his or her missile attack bonus as a bonus to his or her initiative (as well as to the attack roll).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Initiative rolls may result in a tie. When this happens, both sides are considered to be acting simultaneously. The GM may handle this situation in any way he or she chooses - with one caveat. The damage inflicted by combatants during simultaneous initiative is inflicted even if one of the combatants dies during the round. It is possible for two combatants to kill each other during a simultaneous initiative round! Under any other circumstance, of course, the effects of damage inflicted during that segment will take effect immediately - a goblin killed in the first segment of the round will be dead (and thus unable to attack) by the time the fifth segment of the round arrives.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Some characters (and creatures) may have more than one attack routine. This does not refer to a monster that normally makes multiple attacks in a round - all of these attacks are considered to be part of one attack routine. However, a fighter whose level grants him an additional attack is considered to be making a second entire attack routine. This is perhaps most clearly seen if the reader envisions a fighter who uses a sword in one hand and a dagger in the other. These two attacks are part of an attack routine - and if the fighter is of high enough level or under the influence of a haste spell, he or she may also gain an entire additional attack routine. A creature or character with multiple attack routines cannot use the second attack routine until after the other side's initiative segment has been resolved.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Once the party with initiative has acted, the party that lost initiative may then take action.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Note about spells: </b>Spells have a casting time, the number of segments (or rounds, turns, etc.) required to cast the spell. The spell caster does not actually begin casting the spell until his or her initiative segment. That segment is the first segment of the casting time. The spell does not \"go off\" until the casting has been completed.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Example: </b>Halvaine the Arcane's party is in battle with a group of orcs. At the beginning of the round, Halvaine's player declares that the magic user will cast a spell with a 2 segment casting time. The party rolls a 5 for initiative, and the GM rolls a 4 for the orcs. Halvaine thus begins casting in the fourth segment of the round (as the ORCS rolled a 4, so Halvaine's party is acting in segment 4). The orcs attack in the fifth segment (as Halvaine's party rolled a 5), and Halvaine's spell will go off in the sixth segment (as his initiative segment is 4, and he adds the casting time of 2) - provided, of course, that the orcish attack in the fifth segment does not interrupt and thus spoil his casting.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"I0IQ9ef7ZhLd66iw":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"d319890827dce112ff67593885131a272f0e15c8","sourceId":"JournalEntry.gYU0T6t2a3FjwiNp","defaultPermission":2},"cf":{"id":"temp_0zi4mj20ctlf","path":"OSRIC-PC#/CF_SEP/Chapter 3: How to Play#/CF_SEP/COMBAT","color":"#000000"}}}

Neither does the spell suddenly imbue an animal with intelligence; the observations and opinions of an animal such as a badger will be appropriate to the animal's own experiences, motives, and intellectual limitations.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"I0IQ9ef7ZhLd66iw":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"6495bab4ce411de75c3df6f84c8ebb474f715163","sourceId":"JournalEntry.gZW1XVrz1aE4aCnF","defaultPermission":2},"cf":{"id":"temp_21dytxls6ry","path":"OSRIC-PC#/CF_SEP/Chapter 2: Spells#/CF_SEP/Cleric Spells","color":"#000000"}}}

{"_id":"glAWdppxui9wy1Ml","name":"Searching the Dungeon","content":"<h1>Searching the Dungeon</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Many OSRIC adventures will involve the characters exploring some enclosed area, be it the dungeons beneath a castle or temple, a system of natural caves and caverns, an abandoned mine, the sewers beneath a city, an enemy fortress, a wizard's tower, or a shrine to some dark god. For convenience, and by tradition, these enclosed locations are collectively called \"dungeons\", which thus refers not just to a set of man-made tunnels but to any indoor adventure location. Indoor/dungeon adventures tend to have similar characteristics and thus the same set of procedures and suggested resolution mechanics applies to most \"dungeon\" adventures.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Order of Play: </b>While exploring in a dungeon, each turn is resolved separately.

Book-keeping: </b>The GM records that a turn has elapsed and deducts any resources that the party has used (lost hit points, spell durations expiring, torches burning out, and so on).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Since each turn represents ten minutes of time, characters may combine several actions in the same turn if each is reasonably brief. Thus a character might draw a sword, move up to a door and attempt to open it all in the same turn, for example. Longer actions may take several turns to resolve (such as making a minute search of a 500 square-ft wall) and sensible parties will take steps to guard a character engaged in such activity from unexpected attack.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The guiding principle behind the exploration rules is to maximise the number of meaningful decisions the players take about their actions, and minimise the number of dice rolls between each decision.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Wandering Monsters: </b>Typically, wandering monsters are checked for every third turn and encountered 1 chance in 6. If a wandering monster does appear, determine the creature involved randomly unless some factor makes it obvious what the party has met.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Some dungeon levels have special provisions for wandering monsters affecting the frequency of checks, the chance of an encounter, or both. For example, in the first level of <i>the Pod Caverns of the Sinister Shroom </i>, the chance of meeting a wandering monster is only 1 in 10.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Wandering monsters in dungeons should be appropriate to the environment both in type of creatures encountered and encounter difficulty. Traditionally dungeons are organised such that the deeper the dungeon level, the more numerous and deadly the creatures encountered - so a group of first level characters exploring the first level of a dungeon should tend to encounter first level monsters, with maybe the occasional second level one, whereas on the sixth dungeon level, characters might expect to meet third or fourth level monsters. This pattern varies from dungeon to dungeon, however. For example, in <i>the Red Mausoleum </i>, an adventure designed for characters level 12 and higher, most monsters are extremely powerful even on the very first level!</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>At the GM's option, wandering monster checks may be made less often or even skipped entirely, but before doing so it is important to think about the reasons behind the rules, and particularly what the wandering monster check should accomplish. The first purpose served by wandering monster checks is to create an impression of complexity in a \"living dungeon\" environment without GM needing to create activity schedules or account for every creature in the dungeon at every moment. Monsters in the dungeon will have various reasons for leaving their lairs: some may be on patrol, others looking for food, and still others exploring the dungeon just like the player characters; all of the above and more are represented by the wandering monster die.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The other purpose of wandering monsters has nothing to do with verisimilitude and is purely a rules construct, but an important one: <i>wandering monsters discourage players from wasting time. </i>If there is no chance of meeting a wandering monster, there is no incentive for the players to keep the game moving no reason why they shouldn't hold long conversations about their course of action and methodically check every inch of floor, walls, and ceiling for traps and hidden treasure. Many players, especially those accustomed to computer games that have no in game time limits, will tend towards a \"pixel-hunting\" approach to play. It is up to the GM, by means of wandering monsters, to discourage this kind of slow play and keep the game moving - otherwise the game will become mired in dull minutiae and nobody will have much fun.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The same principles also apply in reverse, though. The GM should adjust the chance of meeting a wandering monster according to the players' approach. If the party is stealthy, swift, and silent, avoids heavily-trafficked areas and does not stay long in any one place, they should encounter few wandering monsters.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>The Role of the Party Caller (Optional): </b>If there are many players in the party, some groups like to designate one player as \"Caller,\" or party spokesman, and filter communication through that single player. This role should not default to a \"party leader\" who gives the other players orders and reduces them to spectators! Rather, some groups may find that by having a single player speak for the whole group, potential chaos of each player competing for the GM's attention is reduced and the game should run more smoothly, improving the play-experience for all involved. Therefore, if a caller is used, he or she should consult with the other players and then report the party's actions quickly and accurately to the GM.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The caller can be anyone and need not be limited to, for instance, the character with the highest charisma or social standing. In fact, we suggest that if the party uses a caller, the role should rotate among the players from session to session, giving each a turn.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Movement during dungeon exploration: </b>Is at the rates listed at the beginning of Chapter 3. This slow, cautious move rate (which works out at a tenth the speed characters move in combat) allows the characters to make a map of their progress, if they wish. When passing through familiar areas or following a map, characters can move at up to five times the normal per-turn move rate (so that a character with a normal move rate of 60-ft could move up to 300-ft per turn if passing through known territory).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Characters fleeing from an encounter may run at ten times their normal per-turn move rate (i.e. at full combat speed). No mapping is possible while fleeing in this manner and a double rest period (see below) is necessary at the end of the pursuit. Since parties will typically want to remain together, movement speed will necessarily be limited to that of the slowest character in the party.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The players should establish, and the party caller inform the GM of, the party's \"marching order\", i.e. which characters are in front, the middle, and bringing up the rear. In a standard 10-ft wide dungeon corridor, up to three characters may walk abreast, though if any are wielding large weapons such as flails or two-handed swords, this may be reduced to two characters or even one. Characters in the second rank may only attack with a long weapon, such as a spear or pole arm, or if they are firing missiles over the head of a shorter character such as a gnome or halfling.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>There are various ways of keeping track of marching order. If miniature figures are in use, they can be placed on some board to indicate where each character is. If miniatures are not in play, most GMs will ask the party to show their marching order on paper. Sensible parties tend to hand the GM a default marching order upon entering the dungeon, and may have standard positions and procedures for other common circumstances as well. A organised group might say to the GM, \"this is our formation when opening a door,\" or \"in 20 foot wide passages we move like this,\" and so forth.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>If the party's position is for some reason unclear to the GM, he or she is well within his or her rights to determine who is where by means of a die roll.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Listening: </b>May be performed in most places, often at doors before opening them. Unless the entire party is still and quiet (no chattering or clanging around), and unless headgear such as helms are doffed, the listener will not detect any noise save the very loudest.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Thieves and assassins have an enhanced chance to hear noise (see \"Thief Skills\" in Chapter 1). Characters of all other classes have a base 10% chance. This should be modified by race; elves, gnomes, halflings, and half-orcs have a base 15% chance.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHear Noise (non-thief): Dwarf, Half Elf, and Human\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHear Noise (non-thief): Elf, Gnome, Half-Orc, and Halfling\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Normally the GM rolls this die in secret, because the player has no way of knowing whether no noise was heard because of the roll or because there was no noise to hear. A character who fails (or thinks he or she has failed) to hear noise may try again, each attempt taking one round. However, no more than three attempts may be made the same character before the strain becomes too great and no further listening attempts will succeed until the character has rested for at least one turn.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>If the check is successful, the GM should decide whether there is in fact any noise to be heard. Some monsters, such as bugbears, are stealthy and cannot be detected by listening. However, generally if there is some monster in the area and a \"hear noise\" check is passed, the party should gain some clue about what it is. Clever players whose characters speak various monster languages may gain valuable information from overhearing snatches of conversation - but the GM should be careful only to describe what characters can actually hear. So the GM would not normally say \"you hear a giant spider,\" but rather \"you hear a scuttling, rattling sound\" as the creature climbs to a suitable spot from which to ambush the party.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Don't forget, monsters can hear the party in the same way as the party can hear them!</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Listening for noise as often as possible, at every door and intersection, is an understandably common tactic, because it's one of the easiest ways for players to improve the odds in their favour - so as to be able to make better-informed decisions about their actions. This is fine in moderation. However, if the pace of play slows considerably, diminishing the excitement and reducing the adventure to dice-rolling, the GM should discourage the players from endless listening attempts. Emphasise the inconvenience of donning and doffing helmets and headgear while the rest of the party stands around doing nothing; and if play is still slow, employ tricks that circumvent listening, e.g. silent monsters or phantom noises (perhaps due to strange acoustics in the dungeon or magic). In extreme cases the GM can place traps and monsters that specifically target listening characters, but before it gets to that, the GM should speak frankly to the players and explain that while some degree of caution is good play, carrying things to extremes only makes the game less fun.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Balance this against the lethality of the dungeon. In extremely dangerous areas, the players should not be punished for taking due care.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Opening doors: </b>Is not normally difficult; the player (or party caller) states the action and the door is opened. However, in some dungeons many doors are stuck and must be forced open. Doors may be locked, braced, jammed, spiked shut or otherwise held fast (by means of a wizard lock spell, for example). Stuck doors may be forced by brute strength (see the strength ability in Chapter 1 for chances of success). Locked doors will need a key, a thief or assassin to pick the lock, or some may be broken down with axes or battering rams. When designing the dungeon, the GM should note which doors are normal, stuck, locked, etc. as well as the locations of any keys.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Attempting to force a stuck door takes one round per attempt and, depending on the size of the door, more than one character may try at once. Thus, two characters could simultaneously try to force a 6-ft wide door - each character makes a check and success by either indicates the door opens. If the first attempt fails, additional tries may be made at no penalty except for time and noise. Attempting to force a stuck door, and particularly multiple attempts on the same door, is noisy and may increase the odds of meeting a wandering monster. In any event, a failed attempt to open a stuck door will prevent surprise on any creature on the other side of the door.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Lock-picking attempts by thieves and assassins are handled in Chapter 1 and take between 1 round and 1 turn per attempt(depending on the complexity of the lock). 1-4 rounds are typical.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLockpicking Time Elapsed - Average Lock\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLockpicking Time Elapsed - Hard Lock\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Chopping down a door with axes or by other means is time-consuming and noisy. It takes a full turn at least to chop down a standard-size door, during which time several wandering monster checks should be made. Naturally, the party will have no chance of surprising any creature on the other side.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Furthermore, once a door is opened, it is usually difficult to keep it open, or for that matter to keep it closed. OSRIC has a double-standard that while adventurers may have a hard time opening doors in dungeons, monsters have no such trouble and can open doors automatically unless the players prevent them. The usual way to hold a dungeon-door open or closed is to wedge it with iron spikes. Even then there is a small chance (at the GM's discretion but often around 20-30%) that a spiked door will slip.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Mapping: </b>A key element of dungeon exploration; but it is one of the most controversial and misunderstood aspects of the game. If not handled carefully, mapping has huge potential to slow down the game and mire it in frustration.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>When designing the dungeon, the GM should map it out on sheets of graph paper, showing the rooms, chambers, corridors, stairways, doors, traps, and other features in relation to one another. As the party moves through the dungeon the GM describes to them what they see and, assuming they have light and proper equipment and are not moving too quickly, the players may choose to draw a map of their own based on the GM's descriptions.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>It is important to understand the purpose of the players' map. The goal is not to create an exact copy of the GM's map, but to keep a record of which areas are explored and which not, to allow the party to find their way back to the entrance and, on subsequent expeditions, find their way back to where they left off. If the dungeon is small or simple in layout the players may not need a map. Even if the dungeon is larger or more complex, a \"trailing map\" with lines for corridors and squares for rooms and chambers, maybe with marginal markings showing length or size, is almost always enough. Only in the most labyrinthine of dungeon levels, with rooms and corridors tightly packed together, are players likely to find making a strictly accurate map rewarding.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>On such levels an accurate map can help the players deduce the locations of secret rooms, show them when they're circling back into areas they've already explored by a different route, or even alert them to some trick - a teleporter, shifting room or wall, sloping passage, or the like. Parties keeping a trailing map, or no map at all, may miss hidden treasures or not realise they have gone astray until hopelessly lost, but careful mapping might quickly reveal something is amiss, allowing the party to backtrack and correct their course or search for a solution. These areas are the most difficult to map, but also the most rewarding and fun, since mapping this sort of level can lead to tangible positive results.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Many players hate mapping, considering it a fun-killing burden, and these players will often try to get the GM to design simpler dungeons or even to draw the map for them. The OSRIC GM should avoid these \"solutions\"; play goes quicker if a player maps. Encourage the players to map appropriately - i.e. only when necessary and use a trailing map where possible.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The GM should make mapping easier by giving effective verbal descriptions: quick, accurate, and reporting only what the party actually sees. Visualise the dungeon in your mind. Describe things in distances rather than squares.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The players may show you their map and ask if it is correct. Comply only if there is a major error that would be obvious to someone in the dungeon (such as a triangular-shaped room where the party entered via the apex but drew their map as if they'd entered from the base) or if your description was faulty - and in the latter case try to make your descriptions more accurate in future.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>In a particularly complicated setup - a room with lots of odd angles, for instance - a quick GM-drawn sketch may be helpful. Do this rarely, and never directly on the players' map.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The players' map represents an actual in-game object. If the players at the table are making a map, then a character must also be making one. This has several corollaries: the party must have light (they can only map what they see) and mapping supplies (something to write with and something to write on), they must be moving slowly and methodically (no more than standard exploration speed), and measuring the size of a room takes time (1 turn per 20-ft×20-ft area is suggested). Perhaps most importantly, if something happens to the map in-game, it happens to the players' map as well! If the mapping character dies and his or her body is left behind, if the characters are captured and stripped of their equipment, or if a jet of acid or a green slime destroys the map, the GM should confiscate it. If the party wants backup copies, the players must actually draw them. If the entire party dies in the dungeon, the only way their maps will survive is if copies were left on the surface.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Clever GMs will see adventure-creating potential here. Maps are a valuable asset for NPCs as well as PCs; map-buying, selling and trading could be rife, and maps found in treasure hoards potentially more valuable than gold.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Searching for hidden treasure, traps, secret doors, and whatnot: </b>A common activity. Looking for secret doors is a time-consuming process, taking a full turn for each 10-ft×10-ft area searched. Even so the chance of success is small: 1 in 6 for most characters, with elves and half-elves having an innate advantage (translating to a 2 in 6 chance). Searching for traps is best done by dwarfs, gnomes, thieves, or assassins - chances for success are as described in Chapter 1. A search for traps generally takes 1-4 rounds, but it is also limited to a specific object or small (no more than 5-ft×5-ft) location specified by the player: \"I search for traps on the door\", \"I search for traps on the treasure chest\", \"I search the area directly in front of the throne for traps,\" etc.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSearching for Traps Time Elapsed\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The GM may allow \"negotiation-based\" searching for secret doors or traps, in which, through careful questioning and described actions, the players may achieve a bonus, or even an automatic success, on a search. For instance, players may tap along a section of wall listening for the echo of a hollow space. If such a space is discovered, the players may describe their attempts to find and trigger the secret door they know is there - perhaps looking for loose or ill-fitting stones, suspicious indentations or cracks, wall-sconces that may turn or pivot, etc. The same approach can work for traps as well.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The GM must adjudicate these negotiated searches. Perhaps they have no effect and the die roll alone decides success or failure - which certainly helps keep the game moving, but may strip away too much of the players' ability to immerse themselves in the situation. Perhaps a careful description can give a bonus to the standard check, or perhaps the description might trump the die-roll entirely - if the player is able to describe a search in such a manner that the GM feels would definitely find the objective. The downside to this is if the player's description is off-base (searching in the wrong place, via the wrong means, etc.) the GM might actually reduce the chance of success.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>These detailed, negotiated searches generally take a long time in-play (more than the standard times listed above) and may increase the odds of encountering a wandering monster. This is, of course, deliberate; without some incentive to keep things moving players might tend to conduct the most thorough searches possible, describing every inch of every room in minute detail, and dragging the game to a grinding halt.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Disarming traps is normally a job for a thief or assassin (with chances of success as shown in Chapter 1) and takes 1-4 rounds per attempt for a simple trap. A complex trap may take a full turn to disarm. Other characters usually have little to no chance of success, though again careful questioning and attention to detail may create exceptions. For instance, a player may be able to surmise that wedging a pressure plate to prevent it from depressing, or stopping a vent with beeswax to prevent gas from issuing from it, could circumvent a trap.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDisarming Trap Time Elapsed - Average Trap\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDisarming Trap Time Elapsed - Hard Trap\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>These sorts of \"negotiation-based\" solutions to traps are wholly at the GM's discretion. Some GMs encourage and reward this sort of play, but others will discourage it, perhaps feeling this slows down the game too much, or circumvents the intended role of the thief class. It is important that the players and the GM discuss this issue to make sure everyone's expectations align - that the players aren't expecting purely roll - based resolution of traps when the GM is expecting them to play out each attempt, or vice versa.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Traps neither avoided nor disarmed will normally trigger 50% of the time. When designing the dungeon, the GM should define each trap by its nature and effect (see the preceding pages on \"Traps\"). In areas designed for first level characters, damage should not normally exceed [[/roll 1d6]] or at worst [[/roll 1d10]] and \"instant death\" effects should be avoided. Lower dungeon levels, on the other hand, are designed for experienced players with high-level characters who should have many ways of dealing with traps, as well as more hit points and better saving throws, so more dangerous and deadly traps may be in order. Even so, the GM should typically allow some kind of saving throw or other way of mitigating the trap's effects.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Some OSRIC groups enjoy even more lethal traps - such as those that cause death with no save. Placing these is a matter for the GM's judgement. Do you wish to encourage the players to raise zombies or call forth unseen servants or summoned monsters and send them ahead? Very lethal traps will probably lead to such behaviour, and in some groups there is a place for this kind of play. Others prefer to avoid it.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Casting spells is detailed in Chapter 2. Many spells, particularly the various detection and divination-type spells, will make the job of exploration easier. It is up to the players to decide the ideal balance between these \"utility\" spells and those oriented towards combat or healing. There are circumstances in which a timed knock or locate object spell may prove just as crucially life-saving as yet another sleep or cure light wounds.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Rest periods are typically necessary one turn out of every six, one turn after each combat, and double-length (two turns) after an evasion or pursuit. Parties that stay in the dungeon for several hours and are not able or willing to return to the surface may spend an entire \"night\" holed up within the dungeon to recover spells. During these periods the party cannot move, nor may they perform any other strenuous action (though passive activities such as mapping should be allowed). Players should be aware of when these rest periods are coming up, and make sure their surroundings are as inconspicuous, or at least defensible, as possible. A small, out-of-the-way room with a single door that can be spiked shut could be a good location to rest in for a single turn or an entire night; in the middle of an open corridor or near a stairway to a lower level is likely a bad place for even a short rest period, and often a suicidal place to spend several hours.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Occasionally, by accident or design, characters will not take these required rest periods and attempt to press on regardless. If this happens, everyone in the party is fatigued. What this means, and what sort of impact it has on the characters, is left to the GM's discretion but likely consequences are a reduced movement rate, penalties in combat, temporarily reduced ability scores, and morale reductions for any NPCs who are accompanying the party. The longer the party goes without resting, the worse these effects become.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Other actions are defined in several of the race and class descriptions in Chapter 1. For instance, a dwarf can attempt to determine depth underground, a gnome can try to determine direction, a paladin can detect evil, a ranger can attempt to follow a set of tracks, and so on. Unless otherwise specified, these actions take one round per attempt.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Beyond these sorts of pre-defined activities OSRIC has no specific system for resolving most other tasks. This is intentional - the player characters are heroes, and should be able to do most mundane things without a roll.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Certainly the authors could have included a skill system covering activities such as \"horse riding\" or \"swimming\", but doing so is actively detrimental to heroic gaming. Had we included a \"horse riding\" skill, characters would start falling off their horses. This strikes us as unnecessary, in the context of heroic adventure gaming, so if you seek a generic skill system for your game, seek it elsewhere. Success at most horse-riding tasks (for example) is automatic.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Where a player character tries something beyond the mundane, the GM should determine the chances of success on an adhoc basis. The GM should look at the circumstances and the character's class, level, race, and ability scores and make an informed judgement about his or her chances of success. This could be a flat judgement - \"you succeed\" or \"you fail\" - but is more commonly a die-roll of some kind. The GM should usually tell the player what the chance is, ask the player if they still wish to proceed, and if so allow the player to make the appropriate roll him- or herself. However the GM always has the right to roll the dice on behalf of the player, or in secret, if the GM feels the situation demands it.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>In determining the ad hoc chance for success for various tasks, it may be helpful for the GM to look at other similar tasks that have already been defined. For instance, the strength-based chances to Open Doors and/or Bend Bars, the magic user's intelligence-based Chance to Know Spells, and the constitution-based roll to survive System Shocks can all be extrapolated to cover a wider variety of situations. The same applies to saving throws, which consider class and level rather than just raw ability, so that high-level characters will be generally more successful than lower level characters, and each class will tend to have areas of speciality (clerics better at tasks that require a save vs death, Magic users at tasks that require a save vs spells, etc.)</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Book-keeping: </b>The GM should set up some simple system for book-keeping and may wish to delegate some tasks to the players. The present author, for example, keeps a piece of scratch paper by his books and makes a tally mark when each turn has elapsed, enabling him to see at a glance when to roll for wandering monsters, when the next rest period is required, and when the party has run out of lantern fuel. In extreme cases, if the campaign has grown so large that ten or more players per session is typical, an assistant GM can help - the assistant, or apprentice, GM helps the main GM with book-keeping and organisation, and may help the main GM design new dungeons and adventures, eventually becoming either a co-GM or branching off into a separate sub-campaign.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"I0IQ9ef7ZhLd66iw":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"425c272314214200465d1c70477611a38c9f0bed","sourceId":"JournalEntry.glAWdppxui9wy1Ml","defaultPermission":2},"cf":{"id":"temp_slzxs9y0tvj","path":"OSRIC-PC#/CF_SEP/Chapter 3: How to Play#/CF_SEP/Adventure and Exploration","color":"#000000"}}}

His \"Three Hearts and Three Lions\" is particularly highly recommended.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"modules/osric-compendium/images/000.001 Paladin.jpg\" height=\"600\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Paladins suffer the following restrictions:</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>First, the paladin may never possess more than ten magic items, and no more than a single suit of magic armour with no more than one magic shield may be so owned.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Second, the paladin must always give away a tenth of any money which he or she receives to some Lawful Good cause, and if he or she has any money remaining after paying his or her costs (such as maintaining equipment and paying servants' wages) this surplus must be likewise donated.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Third, paladins will not associate with characters who are not Good in alignment save under very exceptional circumstances (i.e., if approved by the GM).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>The Paladin Character</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Minimum Scores: Str 12, Dex 6, Con 9, Int 9, Wis 13, Cha 17</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Hit Die Type: [[/roll 1d10]] (max 9)</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Alignment: Lawful Good only</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Experience bonus: Str and Wis 16+</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Armour/Shield Permitted: Any</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Weapons Permitted: Any</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Weapon Proficiencies: 3+1 every 2</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Penalty to hit for non-proficiency: -2</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Weapon Specialisation: Optional rule - as fighter</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Paladin Class Abilities</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Improved Saving Throws: </b>The paladin uses a more favourable saving throw table than other classes (see table, below).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Cure Disease: </b>Paladins can cure disease (as the clerical spell) by touch, once per week.

{"_id":"m9iBuCWLULuOihAm","name":"Magic User","content":"<h1>Magic User</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Magic users are a rare breed - practitioners of the mysterious art of arcane spell casting. A lengthy apprenticeship of study and practice allows these somewhat eerie individuals to store arcane energy within their minds and to release it in the form of spells. Magic users cast spells by speaking a few magic words, weaving complex gestures in the air, and employing rare and magical materials. While magic users (with illusionists) are the weakest character class in combat, this weakness is balanced by possessing the most powerful and versatile spells in the game.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The full underlying principles of magic are beyond mortal comprehension; even wizards of the profoundest intellect struggle from momentary inklings to understand its more complex patterns. Nevertheless, those character who possess formidable intelligence and a certain intuitive gift, who are willing to devote themselves to a lifetime of study, may in time sufficiently master the art to be capable of shifting mountains and shattering entire armies. High-level magic users are the most feared and dangerous characters in the game.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Magic users do not gain bonus spells for high intelligence scores; intelligence does determine which spells they can understand and how many spells they may learn for each spell level.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Magic users are dependent upon their spell books, and normally may only cast spell they have learned from these books (exception: magic users may cast spells from arcane magical scrolls). Mages may not cast spells from divine, druidic or phantasmal magic scrolls. The acquisition of a new spell is difficult and demanding and must normally be accomplished through adventuring, although the mage will automatically receive one new spell of the highest spell level that he or she may cast upon acquiring a new level of experience.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>OSRIC magic users are superficially similar to the wizards of fantasy literature such as Gandalf and Merlin, but they are more closely similar to mages described in the works of Jack Vance. His \"Dying Earth\" cycle, and particularly \"Rhialto the Marvellous\", are highly recommended.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Magic users are the only class capable of fabricating magic items that they cannot themselves employ. Clerics, druids and illusionists can fabricate magic items, but only those they themselves can use; items such as magical swords, that no primary spell casting class may use, are in their creation the sole province of magic users.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>At 11th level, a magic user may establish a stronghold (usually a tower or small keep) in the same manner as a fighter.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>The Magic User Character</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Minimum Scores: Str 3, Dex 6, Int 9, Wis 6, Con 6, Cha 6</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Hit Die Type: [[/roll 1d4]] (max 11)</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Alignment: Any</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Experience bonus: Int 16+</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Armour/Shield Permitted: None</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Weapons Permitted: Dagger, dart, oil, staff</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Weapon Proficiencies: 1+1 per 5 levels</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Penalty \"to hit\" for non-proficiency: -5</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Weapon Specialisation: N/A</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Magic User Class Abilities</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Spell casting: </b>Magic users may memorise and cast arcane spells in accordance with the tables provided below.

(For example, a spell-casting dragon might save as a magic user or a fighter, whichever is better.) The level at which monsters cast spells is also normally determined by their hit dice unless the creature's description indicates otherwise. For example, a magic-using dragon with 11 HD would cast spells as a 12th level spell caster.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Huge but unintelligent creatures may have their equivalent level reduced for the purposes of saving throws, subject to the GM's discretion; creatures such as dinosaurs would be appropriate for this. On rarer occasions, it may also make sense to reduce the creature's effective level for the purposes of attack tables also; this might apply to a herbivorous dinosaur, for example.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Please note that certain creatures have a special bonus to their effective attack level.

{"_id":"n26SzNVFaUcshNjp","name":"Random Wilderness Encounters","content":"<h1>Random Wilderness Encounters</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>For the purposes of Wilderness Encounter Tables it is recommended the most prevalent terrain within the party's current hex be used. This means a party in the foothills of a mountain range, a hex with mostly hills and a few mountains, would use the \"Hills\" encounter table. With a little imagination, these tables should allow the GM to generate interesting and challenging encounters. The user should bear in mind that many terrain types encompass many different lands and dice may dictate an encounter the GM feels inappropriate to the situation. If this should happen feel free to re-roll, choose arbitrarily from the list, or find a way to make an unusual encounter work. The \"Special\" encounter column included with each terrain type is aimed specifically at introducing these chaotic types of encounters into your milieu.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Unlike dungeon encounters, wilderness encounters are not keyed to party level or strength. As a rule of thumb, the GM should use the \"No. Encountered\" entry in the rulebook to generate specific numbers. Players, for their part, should learn and develop the fine art of running away. Wandering about the wilderness of most campaign milieus is a hazardous pastime.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>The Human (and Demi-human) Encounter Table lists various settlements and strongholds. </b>These may be used to insert adventure hooks into the campaign, or give the party a relatively safe place to rest and re-equip. They may, of course, be ignored if they do not fit with your plans. We have limited the encounters to hamlets, villages, and small keeps in order to not interfere with the GM's carefully designed maps.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The NPC Tables, explained more fully below, maybe used to generate lone NPCs or complete adventuring NPC parties. Tables are provided for generating NPCs and NPC parties in the Dungeon Encounter Tables section of these rules.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><h1>Regarding the Lost World Encounter Tables:</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Lost World settings are chaotic places. <b><i>OSRIC </i></b>adds a little chaos into the tables but feel free to expand upon this idea. You may wish to add encounters with UFO aliens, Tarzan(tm), present day humans from non-magical and high science worlds, even a giant ape which fancies itself a King.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Past, Present, and Future <i>time travellers </i>are labels relative to the player character's \"normal\" time.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<i>Dinosaurids </i>are man-sized evolved dinosaurs roughly equivalent to humans in terms of stats, particularly intelligence.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<i>Cavemen </i>are roughly equivalent to Neanderthal proto-humans. The <i>advanced cavemen </i>referred to by the tables are akin to Cro-Magnon proto-humans.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The <i>Time-Lost Village </i>encounter refers to a settlement of humans or Demi-humans that is \"unstuck in time\" and randomly relocates to various eras, perhaps even changing physical location when time-shifting. One may look to various sources for inspiration, including the musical \"Brigadoon\", the UK television series \"Dr. Who\", and the US television series \"The Time Tunnel.\"</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><h1>Explanation of NPC Types</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<i>Decoys </i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>: </b>serve either to distract the party from something else, or put the party at ease and lure them into a dangerous situation.

Mermen are much like rural humans, farming and harvesting vegetation on the ocean floor and hunting in the area around their settlements; they hunt for fish and other sea-going creatures.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Merfolk have been known to herd certain fish, keeping them corralled in large, spherical netted seaweed pens in much the same way their human counterparts will herd cattle.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Merfolk tend to congregate in small communities, establishing their dwellings in reefs or underwater cliffs and tunnelling many rooms and passages into these natural structures.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Rarely, mermen will construct dwellings of natural materials such as seashells, coral, rocks, and materials scavenged from sunken sailing vessels. The community will consist of roughly equal numbers of mermen, mermaids (as the female of the species is called), and younglings. These communities, no matter the location, will correspond to a human agricultural type community in many respects: there will be workshops, residences, pens for the food fish, and storage areas for the harvested sea vegetation. Merfolk communities are guarded by [[/roll 3d6]] giant gar (q. v.), bred and trained by the mermen for this purpose. Merfolk rarely venture from the ocean but can sometimes be spotted sunning themselves on coastal rocks in isolated areas.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>In battle, half the merman troops encountered will be armed with dagger and trident. The remainder of the forces will be evenly split between crossbow and dagger; or net, javelin, and dagger. Mermen crossbows are identical in function to the sahuagin crossbow (see monster listing: sahuagin). If the mermen encountered are seeking to capture a surface ship (see below) 25% of the trident-armed troops will also be equipped with grapples that have 50 ft of line attached.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Though mermen tend to avoid humans under most circumstances, they have been known to attack and sink surface vessels to plunder them </b>. <b>Grappling hook-equipped mermen will surface and hurl their grapples up to 30 ft as the other mermen attack exposed crewman on the ship with crossbows and thrown javelins </b>. The merfolk are quite proficient with grapples and will successfully score a hit on a roll of 1-9 on a [[/roll 1d10]]. If a grapple hits it will be grabbed and held by 10 mermen, causing the ship to lose 30 ft per round of top speed for each successful grapple attack. If the crew of the ship manages to cut a grapple line it will take the 10 mermen holding the line a round to regroup and return to the fight. <b>Any merman grappling the ship or laying down cover fire is exposed to ranged attack from the ship </b>. <b>Further, fire based attacks will cause double damage but only for a single round </b>. If the grappled ship is successfully rendered motionless it will be pulled underwater in [[/roll 4d4]] rounds.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Any crewmen abandoning ship at this time will be ignored as the ship and mermen sink beneath the waves. Mermen do not take surface dwellers prisoner, but will not normally harm any crewmen in the water - unless the crew of the ship foolishly try to continue the battle.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Description: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</i>Merfolk appear as completely normal humans from the waist up and as man-sized fish or dolphins from the waist down.

If there is great demand for them however, they could be added later in an update to the extent such is possible within the game engine. </i>]</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Artifacts</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Artifacts are the relics of ancient civilisations which the combination of age, long-forgotten magics, and otherplanar influences have elevated beyond the power of even the most potent magic items. A well known example of an artifact would be the One Ring from Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, or the krang from Alan Dean Foster's \"The Tar-Aiym Krang.\" As one might deduce, the power of an artifact is potentially destructive to the campaign in which it is introduced and artifacts should therefore never be randomly generated or lightly placed. Artifacts are divided into two groups: minor and major. Major artifacts are unique items of great power, to rival that of the gods. Minor artifacts are not unique, though still quite rare, and of somewhat lesser power than major artifacts. Any artifact, major or minor, is nearly impossible to destroy.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><h1>Minor Artifact Descriptions</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Book of Infinite Spells (any): </b>This ancient tome appears to be a non-descript and well used travelling spellbook of the type favoured by adventuring wizards. This artifact grants to any player of any class the ability to cast the spells contained within its pages, though any character of a class unable to cast spells will function at one level lower while in possession of the artifact. The book of infinite spells contains [[/roll 2d6+20]] pages (22-32 pages) and the nature of the spell scribed on each page is determined randomly using [[/roll 1d10]], with a die roll of 1-5 indicating an arcane magic spell and a roll of 6-10 indicating divine magic. GMs may use the following table to assist with random selection of spells.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Book of Infinite Spells spell levels</u>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<table>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tbody><tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>D%</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Spell level</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>d%</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Spell level</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>01-05</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>4th</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>71-85</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>7th</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>06-50</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>5th</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>86-95</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>8th</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>51-70</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>6th</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>95-00</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>9th</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t</tbody></table>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>This artifact book has a rather curious property - the pages may only be turned from front to back. Once a page has been turned, it may never be unturned, and the book always opens to the page it was on when last used. When the last page is turned the book vanishes and if the player lost a level when first opening the book that level is restored to the player. The owner can cast the spell scribed upon the active page once per day and if the spell is one usable by the user's class it can be cast up to four times per day. The book's owner need not have the book on his or her person to use its power. The spells inscribed therein may not be copied into a spellbook, for the magic is bound up within the artifact itself, nor may a page be ripped from the book without destroying it.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Any casting of a spell from the book creates an energy feedback which has a chance of causing the page to magically turn. This turning of the page will occur in spite of any precautions taken to prevent from it doing so. Of course, due to the random nature of the book's content, the turning of the page to a new spell may actually benefit the owner. The owner knows the newly-available spell as soon as this occurs. The book of infinite spells is treated as a scroll in terms of actual casting time, effects, saving throws, material components and so on.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Condition and Chance of Page Turning</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Caster employing a spell usable by class and level: 10%</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Caster employing a spell not usable by class and level: 20%</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Non-spellcaster employing a divine or druidic spell: 25%</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Non-spellcaster employing an arcane or phantasmal spell: 30%</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Deck of Many Things (any): </b>This artifact is the ultimate two-edged sword, conferring effects both beneficial and baneful. It consists of a deck of 22 finely-carved ivory plaques in an intricately-carved box of polished ebony. There have also been reports of versions of the deck consisting of fine vellum cards in a leather bag. The individual carvings on the plaques or cards are composed mainly of an archetypal character derived from ancient human lore and a variety of runes of power. The owner of the deck draws as many plaques as he or she wishes from the deck and whatever effect is bestowed takes place instantly, whether for weal or woe.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The following conditions apply to using this artifact. First, the owner must declare beforehand exactly how many cards he or she wishes to draw from the deck before he or she begins; otherwise he or she will be unable to draw from the deck. Once the number of cards is declared they must be drawn from the deck within an hour of each other. If the character does not draw the declared number of cards from the deck, either willingly or unwillingly, at the end of one hour the specified number of cards will flip out of the deck automatically at the rate of one per turn. Each time a card is drawn it is returned to the deck before drawing again, making it possible to draw the same card multiple times.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The table on the following page is a listing of the various plaques and their effects, following the table is a more complete description. Included is a corresponding card, both Tarot and common playing card, so the GM can have the player actually draw from a deck.

Stats for the dread wraith are included here (and not in the monster section - because this is the only situation in which such a beast can appear.)</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<i>Star: </i>The player may choose the ability increased by this card but the points may not be divided between two abilities.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<i>Sun: </i>Roll on the magic items table until an item usable by the player is generated.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<i>Talons: </i>Immediately upon drawing this plaque, all magical items owned by the character (not just those carried) disappear.

In sunlight, the dread wraith cannot drain levels.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Wraiths are shadowy, man-like shapes, dark and indistinct.

The hammer of thunderbolts strikes as a +3 weapon and deals [[/roll 4d6]] damage, and can also be hurled as a missile weapon (30-ft range bands) which will return to the wielder after the attack is resolved. Note that this is the maximum power the item can attain if wielded by a cleric; only one who can wear the belt of giant strength can unlock its full potential.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>If the wielder is wearing both gauntlets of ogre power and a belt of giant-strength the slumbering power of the hammer of thunderbolts is revealed to the wearer. First, the owner knows the weapon for what it is. Second, the weapon gains a full +5 attack bonus, all damage bonuses from the ham- mer, gauntlets, and belt stack, and the weapon will strike dead any giant on a successful hit. The giant is allowed a saving throw vs death magic to avoid the instant death but not the damage.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Further, when hurled the weapon gains a new power. On a successful attack the hurled weapons emits a clap of thunder which stuns all living creatures within 90-ft (saving throw vs petrifaction to avoid).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Chiselled into the base of the stone hammerhead are the words \"Æsir Hammers, Ltd.\"</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Philosopher's Stone (any): </b>Produced by an alchemist of some long-forgotten civilisation, the philosopher's stone appears as an unremarkable, dull black rock of irregular shape and about the size of a clenched fist. Upon inspection the stone seems heavy for its size and, if spun on a flat surface the stone wobbles about its axis as if the centre were liquid. Breaking the stone open will reveal the hollow centre is filled with alchemist's quicksilver, a wonderful substance able to transmute base metals such as lead or iron into pure gold or silver. The amount of alchemist's quicksilver in the philosopher's stone is sufficient to convert 5,000 lbs of iron into pure silver, or 1,000 lbs of lead into gleaming, pure gold. The potent magic of the stone also has another use. The quicksilver can be mixed with a curative potion to create oil of life. When applied to a corpse the oil acts as a resurrection spell.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The quicksilver is sealed into the stone because it breaks down rapidly when exposed to air. The quicksilver must be used within 24 hours of breaking the stone or it loses its potency forever. Any use of the quicksilver uses all the contents of the stone, so one must decided beforehand whether to produce silver, gold, or the oil of life.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Sphere of Annihilation (IM): </b>This \"object\" is not so much something as pure nothing, a spherical wound in reality consisting of a malignant absence of matter. Any matter from the Prime Material Plane coming into contact with the sphere is sucked into its utter blackness, instantly and irrevocably destroyed. A wish cannot restore the unfortunate victim; only the direct intervention of a deity may do so.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A sphere of annihilation can be moved without touching it, using only the power of the mind. The character must roll a save vs death magic, modified by +1 for each point of intelligence over 15, to move the sphere 10-ft per round plus 5-ft for each point he or she exceeded his or her save. Initial control of the sphere can be attempted from as far away as 40-ft and once control is gained the distance the sphere can be controlled increases to 40-ft+10-ft per controlling character's level. If a control check fails the sphere slides 10-ft in the direction of the controller who was attempting to move it. Controlling a sphere uses all of a character's actions for that round.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Control of the sphere can be challenged. All creatures attempting to gain control of the sphere roll their saves as above, and the rolls are compared. If all fail their saving throws the sphere moves 10-ft toward the one who rolled the lowest number. If only one saves, he or she gains control of the sphere for 1 round. If more than one (or all) vying for control of the sphere of annihilation make their saving throws, the person exceeding their saving throw by the most number of points gains control. Should the contest for control of the sphere come out exactly equal, control should pass to the person with the highest intelligence score or, failing that, have the players roll d% and give control to the random winner.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The sphere of annihilation cancels most magic in the same way it absorbs matter. Therefore spells such as dispel magic and the various protections from magic have no effect on the sphere. There are, however, two exceptions. First, if a rod of cancellation touches the sphere, the incompatibility of the respective connections to the Negative Material Plane will cancel each other with great vigour. The resulting explosion will inflict [[/roll 2d6]]×10 damage on everything within a 60-ft radius, no saving throw allowed. Second, a gate spell has a 50% chance of destroying the sphere (roll 01-50 on d%), a 35% chance of having no effect at all (51-85), or a 15% chance (86-100) of ripping a hole into the very fabric of reality and sucking everything within 180-ft of the now-destroyed sphere into the tear and depositing it on an alternate plane of existence.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>See also: <i>Talisman of the Sphere.</i></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Talisman of Pure Good (CP): </b>Any cleric or paladin of good alignment (LG, NG, CG) can use this artifact to damn an evil cleric (LE, NE, CE) up to 100-ft away to a fiery judgment. When the talisman is activated, the ground cracks open at the cleric's feet, flames shooting upward as the victim is sent hurtling down to the very centre of the earth. The following round the ground closes and forever after, nothing will grow on that spot.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The wielder of the talisman must be exceptionally pure of thought and deed, or else the target of the talisman's effect gains a saving throw vs death magic to leap aside as the crack forms. It should be also noted the target must be standing on solid ground for the talisman to function. None but a good paladin or cleric may use the talisman of pure good, and none but an evil cleric may be damned by it. Any neutral cleric (LN, N, CN) touching the talisman takes [[/roll 6d6]] damage, no saving throw allowed. An evil cleric touching the talisman takes [[/roll 8d6]] points of damage, no saving throw allowed. The talisman is inert to any other character.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Talisman of the Sphere (IM): </b>This item is only usable by arcane or phantasmal spell casters. Any character unable to cast arcane or phantasmal spells cannot use the talisman and, in fact, will take [[/roll 5d6]] points of damage if they attempt to pick it up. The talisman, consisting of a braided gold and adamantine cable forming a loop closed by an adamantine handle, allows a magic user to exert greater control over a sphere of annihilation (see above) by increasing the character's modifier on the control check (double intelligence bonus and character level). A character using the talisman to exert influence on a sphere of annihilation need only check for maintaining control every other round after initial control is established. If the wielder fails to establish initial control or subsequently loses control, the sphere will move toward him or her at a rate of 10-ft per round. Though spells such as dispel magic are ineffective against a sphere of annihilation, these spells function normally when used on the talisman of the sphere - which counts as 20th level for the purposes of dispel magic attempts.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Talisman of Reluctant Wishes (any): </b>This nondescript artifact causes any character touching it to try to roll his or her charisma or less on [[/roll 1d20]].</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>If he or she fails the roll by exceeding his or her charisma score, the talisman acts as a stone of weight (detailed in the \"Cursed Magic Items\" section). Discarding or destroying the talisman results in [[/roll 5d6]] damage, no save allowed, and the talisman disappears.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Success means the talisman will remain with the character for [[/roll 5d6]] hours or until he or she makes a wish with it. When one or the other event occurs, the talisman disappears.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>If he or she rolls a natural 20 the character and talisman become bound together for a number of months equal to his or her charisma score and he or she will be unable to rid him- or herself of the talisman during that time. The artifact will grant the owner one wish for every six points of charisma during this time, but as above all wishes must be used before the time expires. During this time the talisman, if held, will grow warm and vibrate whenever the owner comes within 20-ft of a magical or mechanical trap. The talisman must be held in order to receive this benefit.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>No matter which result is rolled, when the talisman of reluctant wishes disappears, a flawless white diamond worth 10,000 gp is left in its place.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Talisman of Pure Evil (C): </b>Any cleric of evil alignment (LE, NE, CE) can use this artifact to banish a good cleric or paladin (LG, NG, CG) up to 100-ft away to an icy prison. When the talisman is activated, the ground cracks open at the victim's feet, chunks of ice flying upward as the victim is sent hurtling down to the very centre of the earth. The following round the ground closes and forever after, only white roses will grow on that spot.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The wielder of the talisman must be relentlessly and irredeemably evil of thought and deed, or else the target of the talisman's effect gains a saving throw vs death magic to leap aside as the crack forms. It should be also noted the target must be standing on solid ground for the talisman to function. None but an evil cleric may use the talisman of pure evil, and none but a good cleric or paladin may be banished by it. Any neutral cleric (LN, N, CN) touching the talisman takes [[/roll 6d6]] damage, no saving throw allowed. A good cleric touching the talisman takes [[/roll 8d6]] points of damage, no saving throw allowed.

The hills are dotted with mostly uncharted caverns and crevices that are home to creatures of all sorts.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>After days of searching and tracking, the party has traced the orcs to a small cave at the southern end of the foothills. A small stream flows into the cave and there is much evidence of foot traffic going in and out.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The party will find the stream is initially shallow and follows the depths of the cave deeper into the hills. As it travels downward, the cave narrows into a tight passageway roughly 4-ft wide and 7-ft in height.

Unless the party takes extreme caution, any entrance through the stream tunnel will cause ripples thus alerting the guards. They will attempt to surprise and attack the first PC to enter by hurling hand axes and then attacking with spear thrusts. Each guard carries [[/roll 2d6]] sp and [[/roll 2d8]] cp on him. This room is occupied with sleeping skins, food of the most terrible sort, and water skins. A crude playing table is covered with a pair of knuckle bone dice, 24 sp and 7 gp.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>2.

This common area is filled with long rough tables, captured tapestries (4 worth 50 gp each; the rest are worthless), assorted silverware and other utensils worth a total of 250 gp, and the stuffed and mounted head of a manticore (the orc leader claims to have slain the creature single-handedly; in actuality he found it already dead from old age and took the head as a trophy... the astute PC will notice the head has no teeth).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>12 orcs (hp 8, 8, 7, 7, 6, 6, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, and 4) stay here when not on duty in the GUARD CAVE or needed elsewhere.

Six are armed with spears and hand axes, four are armed with short swords and spears, and the two orcs with 8 hp are armed with broad swords and wearing chainmail armour and carry shields. The two toughest orcs keep on their persons [[/roll 3d20]] gp and [[/roll 4d8]] sp each.

The inventory is as follows: 1 stack of 25 spears, 1 pile of 6 daggers, 1 pile of 5 short bows, 2 piles of 5 quivers each (one pile has all quivers fully filled; the second pile has quivers in various states of capacity), 1 stack of 8 short swords, and 1 stack of 5 halberds.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>4.

On deeper expeditions, the entourage will be made up only of henchmen. Determine the ability scores, class and level of hirelings and henchmen by rolling on the appropriate sub-tables in the \"Hirelings and Henchmen\" section. They will have one third the level of their master plus 1 level for every 3 of their master's levels. For example, a 9th-lvlmagicuser NPC may be accompanied by a 6th-lvl magic user henchman.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Equipment: </b>NPC parties should be equipped with arms, armour and supplies typical to a party of dungeon delvers. Henchmen should be assumed to have equipment ap- propriate to their level. Hirelings will only possess lower quality arms and armour and few supplies.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Spells: </b>The GM should assume NPC and henchmen spell- casters will have memorised a full assortment of spells appropriate to their party as a whole.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Notes on Play: </b>When a player party encounters a party of NPCs and their henchmen, the GM should carefully consider the alignment and makeup of the NPC party before determining their course of action. A relatively weaker NPC party than the players' may use alternate means to resolve the situation. Trickery, parley, bluffing and fleeing are all important possibilities to consider before finally resort- ing to combat. Unless they are surprised, the GM should always treat them as alert and prepared for anything. Once actual contact has been made with an NPC party, the GM should check for reaction. Whatever the result of the negotiations, NPC parties will NEVER choose to join the PCs unless it is to their immediate advantage. This should also involve few if any rewards for the players' party. Unlike monster encounters, the GM should personally direct the actions of the NPCs as if they were player characters. Rather than checking morale as usual, the GM should favour the course of action that is likely to bring the NPCs the greatest benefit.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>If the NPC party bests the players they need not kill them. Ransom, slavery, imprisonment or sacrifice are interesting alternatives to simple execution.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Finally, it is highly recommended that the GM prepare for encounters with random NPC groups before actual play begins. By generating a list of such parties in advance, the GM can quickly refer to them without stopping play. After the encounter the GM can either cross-off the NPC party from his or her list or make additional notations for future reference.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Party Magic

The content that is made read-only is done so because this adapter has learned by experience it is very easy to unintentionally write over the base template for, say, an elf fighter/magic user, while making what is intended to be a specific NPC, if the template allows overwriting. And then lose the template unless recreating it (and re-dropping the new template in all the tables pulling from the NPC lists, etc., which would otherwise serve up an NPC record which is now a personalized elf fighter-magic user on certain roll results)</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>However, given how the Fantasy Grounds Forge automatically updates, <b><u>PLEASE drag-copy all base content and work with a fresh version </u></b>so that your work isn't overwritten by automatic updates from the FG Forge.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>NPC Saves and Combat; and Surprise</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>The FG 1E extension hard codes 1E monster to-hit values and saving throws for all NPCs - even (demi-)humans with classes. </b>So, for example, a 5th level human wizard NPC will hit AC 4 with a roll of \"11\" instead of \"17\" - a significant difference! Likewise, the NPC wizard's save vs spells of \"12\" would be revised to a 5HD monster's save vs spells of \"14\".</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>This is easily mitigated by copying a global effect on to the classed NPC's character sheet, in the \"Effect Features\" section near the bottom of the front page of an NPC entry. ( <b><i>Note that the resulting changes don't show for rolls made outside of the combat tracker, only inside of it </i></b>- if you make \"practice rolls\" outside of the tracker these effects won't observably modify the rolls.)</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>TO-HIT MODIFYING EFFECTS:</u>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>To equalize combat rolls, use the following effect in the \"Effect Features\" portion of the NPC character sheet (below most of the basic character info on the Main (or cover) tab.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>ATK:\"x\"</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>so for our wizard above, I'd want their to hit rolls treated as six worse than were rolled, since the engine will determine hits against a baseline of \"11\". So I'd add an effect of minus six (-6), like so:</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>ATK:-6</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Now if our wizard rolls a natural (or modified) \"17\", the engine will reduce that to an \"11\" and judge it successfully hits an AC of 0 (against its hard-coded comparison value of \"11\" hitting AC 0 for a 5HD creature).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>ATTACK VALUES FOR 0-LEVEL AND NPCs HAVING HIGH HIT DICE:</u>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>For calculating the appropriate combat matrix, the 1E extension doesn't recognize hit dice greater than 16, or less than \"1-1\" (or, \"one hit die minus one hit point\"); i.e., having combat ability that is worse than a goblin's.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>If you input values exceeding 16 or less than 1-1 (such as \"0\" or \"20\") then the attack matrix fuzzes out to show 20s across the range of all dice results. But if the GM desires, it is still possible to automate improved or reduced combat results for high- and low-HD creatures by using the modifier discussed above.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>For creatures having attack values less than a goblin, such as most normal 0-level humans, insert \"1-1\" into the hit dice field so that the attack matrix table is functioning; then insert an \"ATK: -1\" (or -2, etc.). This should cover such things as non-adventuring humans.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>For high hit dice NPCs, input 16 into the hit dice field. You can still put the correct amount into the hit points field - i.e., a creature can show hit dice of 16 while having a hit point range of [[/roll 20d8]] in the field to the right of the hit point box. Then give the NPC the \"ATK: X\" modifier you desire.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>SAVE MODIFYING EFFECTS:</u>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>All classed NPC templates provided to the GM have correct saving throw values set for them; taking into consideration such variances as dwarf bonuses at a minimum dwarf constitution, \"best-of\" selections for multiclassed characters, etc.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>NOTE THAT CHANGING HIT DICE (even accidentally deleting a previous number) RESETS SAVING THROW VALUES TO THE BASELINE FOR A FIGHTER CHARACTER OF THE UPDATED HIT DICE.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>I've done this accidentally done this, often, while making these modules <b>.</b></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>I still prefer setting values directly, even at risk of reset. However, a GM can instead leave the base saving throw values and enter modifiers similar to the ATK modifiers above. This insures an accidental delete or write-over doesn't require re-inputting all the save fields individually.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Use this template to insert a similar global effect modifying saving throw rolls, that works similarly to the effect described above:</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>POISON: ;PARALYZATION: ;DEATH: ;ROD: ;STAFF: ;WAND: ;PETRIFICATION: ;POLYMORPH: ;BREATH: ;SPELL:</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>So for our 5th level wizard, I don't want him to save as a 5HD monster (which is the same as a 5th level fighter - <i>which also means NPC fighters will never need saving throw modifiers! </i>), because there are variances in every category.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Paralyzation/Poison/Death </b>: wizard (14); monster (11)</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Rod/Staff/Wand </b>: wizard (11); monster (13)</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Petrification/Polymorph </b>: wizard (13); monster (12)</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Breath Weapon </b>: wizard (15); monster (13)</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Spell </b>: wizard (12); monster (14)</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>so I'd input the following specific modifiers:</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>POISON:-3;PARALYZATION:-3;DEATH:-3;ROD:2;STAFF:2;WAND:2;PETRIFICATION:-1;POLYMORPH:-1;BREATH:-2;SPELL:2</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>And now a 5th level NPC wizard will save \"correctly\".</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>If there is no difference for a particular save category </u>(for example, there often isn't for mid-level clerics against a medium hit dice monster's rods/wands/staff save) you can either enter \"0\" (sans quote marks) for the category(-ies), or just delete the relevant category(-ies) in the global effect for that NPC sheet. I prefer to just enter zeroes as it's faster.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>SURPRISE:</u>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>One quick note - the 2E system of adding dexterity adjustments to a rolled surprise value is also hard coded, and can return a green \"you're not surprised\" result when a natural \"2\" is rolled by a high DEX character. in OSRIC dexterity adjustments don't modify the die result, but there are several ways to handle it:</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>1. Don't use the FG surprise mechanic; just roll a [[/roll 1d6]] in chat</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>2. if using the mechanic simply ignore the \"green/good\" visual, instead focusing on the natural \"2\" FG indicates was rolled, and run surprise.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>3. If no dexterity adjustments apply the FG mechanic works perfectly fine. So another work around is to have an average DEX character designated to roll surprise for the group, if there aren't any other mitigating circumstances - such as a ranger character with a \"1\" surprise value, who should roll instead (provided they don't have a high enough DEX to make the mechanic inaccurate).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Also, note that variations from a surprise value of \"2\", or other such modifiers, must be entered manually by clicking the \"Combat\" gear in the Actions tab - such as that of the aforementioned ranger. There you can change the default surprise value from \"2\" to \"1\", or imput a temporary mod for drunkeness, etc., if it will last long enough that an entry is deemed more convenient than ad hoc adjustments each time it is rolled.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Variant Monsters and Tribal Spell Casters</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>One aspect of OSRIC which should make it much easier for a GM to provide a dynamic play environment is the detailing of all variants discussed under a base monster entry. If a description says a monster type has sub-chiefs or war-band leaders which differ from the base monster type, these are provided instead of requiring a beleaguered GM to either make these on the fly, or forego the verisimilitude such variance provides.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>However, the base monster description remains the location of any tables or embedded NPCs relating to that monster as a type - these aren't replicated in variants, to save space. So always look to the main/base monster entry for reference information for that monster, even in the rare situation a base version of that monster isn't present.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Tribal spell casters are also provided, and embedded in the base monster entries for easy access. NOTE: they each have a basic spell selection so they can be used on the fly as needed, but the \"full\" (they're very abridged lists) of spells available to shaman and witch doctors are given in the \"Tribal Spell Casters\" reference manual entry, for a GM's use in preparing encounters.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>In making tribal spell caster NPCs, the optional OSRIC rule allowing them extra hit points and combat bonuses for high \"levels\" of spellcasting is used. If you don't wish this optional rule to apply you can copy and modify the templates.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Cursed Items</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>One aspect I plan to continue working on is the cursed item tables - I'm not quite happy with how they pull results at the moment, but this is due to FG primarily centering on delivering \"completed\" content.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>In OSRIC there are some few specific cursed items, but the tables mostly deliver results with some guidelines directing you as GM to make a unique items along the guidelines given.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>In any event, currently, be aware that seeminly-odd results in magic item random rolls should be checked to see if a cursed item was called for. It it was, and you have time, review the cursed item text for guidelines about how to insert a cursed item of your own creation. Or you can substitute one of the limited number of specific cursed items included in OSRIC (or just ignore and re-roll for a non-cursed item, if seeking a table result in the middle of play).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Encounter Tables</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>OUTDOOR ENCOUNTERS</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Most \"outdoor\" encounter tables do not provide a FG encounter data type - the output a story entry. This is because in OSRIC an outdoor random encounter might be the monster stumbling upon the PCs while out and about, or it might be the PCs stumbling upon where the monster lives (its \"lair\"). The either/or aspect requires determination, and the story delivered has a table embedded giving that information plus the number appearing. Generate this information and drop the NPC type into a fresh encounter.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The lair designation is also very important because a monster encountered randomly in-lair may have treasure somewhere inside if defeated! Whereas if encountered away from its lair it more likely has nothing, or perhaps some magic items it owns which it can carry and use in combat if applicable. The ability to track a monster's trail back to its lair and collect treasure from it is one reason why a ranger is very valuable to a party of PCs...</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Each monster NPC Details tab also has an embedded table for its treasure type - if it keeps treasure - to make it easy for a GM to generate all the information necessary to support exploring/hex-crawling on the fly.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>DUNGEON/URBAN ENCOUNTERS</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Unlike outdoor encounters, random dungeon and urban encounters are always assumed to be \"away from lair\". So these default to providing an FG encounter entry for immediate use in uploading to the combat tracker.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>NOTABLE EXCEPTION - PILGRIMS, CARAVANS, AND NPC ADVENTURING PARTIES</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>These three groups are complex - they each come with multiple leveled NPCs and often large numbers of non-leveled NPCs. The leveled NPCs are very likely to have magical items for use should the PCs desire to enter into politics by other means with them.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>They shouldn't be created \"on-the-fly\". However, a handy generator is provided for each of these types to take the vast majority of routine table rolling and automate it. The GM should be able to take the output results and apply their individual taste and creativity to finalize memerable and fun-to-play encounters showcasing the game world's depth. Caravans may have needed wares and be willing to restock the party while they're on the road; pilgrimages and carvans may offer the safety of numbers to parties traveling in the same direction; NPC parties offer peer rivals (or allies) and remind players that others seek the same sorts of adventure; not all hooks remain available forever.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>And of course - all of these often carry riches and magic otherwise only available in a dragon's lair. An evil pilgrimage could represent quite a haul. Are the players willing to gamble fighting peer apex predators such as themselves? Such is the thing memories are made of.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>However, all of this complexity translates to enormous sized files for each of these. Several nearly--completed versions of these NPC types - awaiting only your creative touches and personalization - are provided as story entries (necessary to convey all the information pertaining to them). As you use the GM's reference module(s) to generate more to replace those used, it is <b><u>HIGHLY </u></b>recommended you export them into their own data modules to bring into the campaign as needed.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Due to the increasing file size as NPC parties increase in levels (and spells, and magic items, etc.) the super-high level NPC adventuring parties discussed by OSRIC on the lowest dungeon levels aren't included here - too much space and bandwith taken every time the program is loaded for uncommon play. If you are using FG to play high level games, just follow the examples provided to create high level NPCs, and NPC parties, to flesh out those tables. The bones are there to put the flesh on.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Each of the three types are handled differently when the random encounter tables call upon them, as follows:</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Caravans and Pilgrims</u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Outdoor: </b>one of the story entries included on the table(s) \"6 ready-to-use caravans\" (or pilgrimages) will be provided to you. Both tables are housed in the GM's Reference module for monsters and encounters and typing \"6 ready\" into the table search field will always pull up these tables. If combat is initiated, drag the NPC character sheets to an encounter you generate and upload to the combat tracker.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Urban: </b>you will get an encounter with individual pilgrim or merchant (and possibly bodyguards) NPCS included in the urban encounters module. However, depending upon how play develops you may want to bring up the monsters and encounters module to roll on the \"ready-to-use\" table(s) and assign them to a caravan or pilgrimage in your world - perhaps the players wish to negotiate joint travel with them, for instance, and you need to know where they're heading. (Or you could just make this up on the fly, too.)</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Dungeon: </b>N/A unless created by the GM</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>NPC Adventuring Parties</u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<i>NOTE: it is easy to pull up the tables containing NPC parties' story entries by searching for \"NPC Parties\" in the table search field. It only returns the relevant tables; the wilderness table is simply an aggregation of the dungeon tables, as wilderness play isn't stratified similarly to dungeon play and any party of any level could be encountered in the wilderness.</i>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Each NPC story entry comes embedded with a dedicated (empty) encounter and parcel, for quick use if combat erupts.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Outdoor: </b>one of the story entries included on the table \"Random Wilderness Encounter - NPC Parties\" table, housed in the GM's Reference module for monsters and encounters, will be provided to you along with a designation of the NPC's party's current disposition (searchers, escapees, runners, etc.).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Urban: </b>N/A for encounters-with-a-party, but the urban encounter tables are loaded with classed NPC encounters. While many of them would be with residents, the GM may wish to deem some of these classed NPCs as members of adventuring parties they have based in that location, or are just passing through but have members which fit the race/class of the randomly encountered classed NPC.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Dungeon: </b>As all NPC adventuring party entries are stories, and the dungeon random encounter matrixes serve up encounter entries, you will receive a encounter containing an empty placeholder NPC whose name directs you to roll on a given table of NPC party stories. Once you've selected an NPC party, drag their character sheets from the story entry into the encounter and upload to the combat tracker.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>DRAGON ENCOUNTERS IN THE DUNGEON</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Similar to NPC adventuring parties, dragons also pull a dummy NPC encounter directing you to roll on a dungeon level-specific table which returns a story entry. This is because dragon encounters pull on nested sub-tables informing the GM whether the dragon can talk, or use magic (and if it does use magic - what spells?). All this information is lost if the dragon table outputs directly to an encounter.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>All the relevant tables to roll on can be located easily by searching \"dragon sub-table\" in the Tables search field. After rolling on the table, drag the dragon NPC(s) from the story provided over to the encounter with the dummy NPC, delete the dummy NPC, and you're ready to upload the dragons to the combat tracker.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Morale</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Just a reminder - don't hesitate to roll this when it applies; and also, not everything failing morale turns and flees. Sometimes it makes a fighting retreat (which gives the players a choice to accept an inconclusive result and preserve their resources), sometimes they surrender, etc.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>But don't spend 30 minutes of valuable game night-time on a combat where monsters always make inexplicable choices to fight to the death as a matter of course.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"I0IQ9ef7ZhLd66iw":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"54f9e1c3f30e16c7a2bc92559e36a7e452adbb51","sourceId":"JournalEntry.uhZQrWovQgOLkReE"},"cf":{"id":"temp_gyy0zmpentu","path":"OSRIC-GM#/CF_SEP/OSRIC#/CF_SEP/Adapter's Notes for Fantasy Grounds - GMs","color":"#000000"}}}

The GM should check for random encounters every three turns or as desired. The GM is encouraged to design his or her own encounter charts keyed to each district or ward. When a pre-designed table is unavailable, the Urban Encounters Table is useful for most circumstances. The GM should exercise discretion when generating random encounters and keep in mind the particular place where the encounter occurs. Improbable or inconvenient results can be ignored and treated as if no encounter occurred. The GM is also encouraged to disguise the true nature of urban encounters by describing NPCs in vague and/or similar terms.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>0-level NPCs</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Most of the NPCs encountered while adventuring in urban or civilised countryside areas are normal folk, with no adventuring profession such as fighting, spell-casting or thievery.

The range also limits the distance at which the magic user's soul may later escape from the jar and into another body. After the caster's soul moves into the jar, his or her physical body becomes inert and lifeless.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The spell represents, in many ways, a contest of will between the magic user and the creature whose body he or she seeks to possess. <u>The caster and the target creature each total their intelligence and wisdom scores (such being calculated or approximated by the GM for a monster). This combined score represents the character's mental power for purposes of the spell. The two numbers are compared, and the difference is used in two important calculations: the saving throw and the chance for escape. One third of the difference (rounded down) is the modifier on the saving throw, a bonus if the target creature has the higher mental power, a penalty if the magic user's mental power is higher.</u></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>If a creature's soul is trapped in the magic jar by the caster, it has a chance to escape. If it escapes, the caster's soul is returned to the magic jar. <u>If the difference in mental power between the caster and the possessed creature is 4 or less in favour of the caster, or is in favour of the possessed creature, the creature can attempt a new saving throw every round. If the difference is from 5 to 8 in the caster's favour, one saving throw is permitted per turn.

{"_id":"vQEJG3GUNNh7tkhO","name":"Morale","content":"<h1>Morale</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Certain monsters, such as trolls or most undead creatures, are fearless and never need to check morale. The majority, however, will not continue to fight a hopeless battle, seeking to retreat, surrender, or flee. The GM determines when morale checks should be made. Generally, morale\" should be checked when it becomes clear that the monsters are losing the fight, or taking unacceptable losses. No more than two morale checks should be made per battle, however; if the monsters pass a second morale check, they are assumed to be fanatical and will fight to the death.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The base morale for most monsters is 50%, plus 5% per hit die of the monster. (Thus for example a monster with 8+1 hit dice gets [8×5%=] +40%, for a total base morale of 90%.) The GM should adjust this according to how cowardly or heroic the monster might be, and also according to the prevailing circumstances. For example, if the monster is very cowardly and fighting opponents who are inflicting serious damage on its fellows without taking any casualties, then the GM might impose a -30% penalty to its morale check. If it is elite and fighting close to its battle standard, the GM might allow a bonus of +10%.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Player characters do not need to check morale. However, hirelings, henchmen, and men-at-arms should be checked for normally. In this case the NPC's morale may be affected by his or her liege's charisma score and/or former conduct towards the NPC; the henchman's alignment may also be taken into account. (As a rule, Chaotic Evil henchmen are much more likely to betray their masters than Lawful Good ones.)</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Effects of Morale Check Failure: </b>Creatures that fail their morale check by a margin of 25% or less will generally seek to make a fighting withdrawal. If they fail by 26% to 50%, they will generally turn and flee; a failure by 51% or higher indicates that the creature surrenders. However, the GM should use logic in conjunction with this guideline, taking into account the creature's intelligence and what it knows. A cornered creature that cannot flee, for example, or a monster that knows that its opponents move faster than it does, will surrender rather than make a futile attempt at flight.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"modules/osric-compendium/images/000.003 how2play2.jpg\" height=\"600\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>No Quarter: </b>Any creature subject to morale that sees surrender is not accepted, sees a prisoner being slain by the other side, or has some reason to believe it will be executed if it surrenders, will never surrender, regardless of other considerations.

An evil cleric can also turn a paladin, but cannot destroy the paladin by turning. Evil clerics may choose to control the undead instead of turning them. If an evil cleric gains a result of \"D\" on the table, the undead creature falls under the cleric's control for 24 hours. Normally [[/roll 2d6]] creatures are affected by Turn Undead.

Weed eels have a single biting attack which injects a powerful poison into the wound: the victim must save or die. A weed eel lair consist of many small tunnels of about 6 inches diameter which eventually join into a series of 6 ft tunnels, which in turn lead to a large cave which is the actual lair. The cave is usually about 600 sq ft and the eels pave the bottom of it with any suitable material they find: small stones, gems, coins, and similar sized shiny objects.

{"_id":"y0b5SBRjWjlK5GQx","name":"Cleric","content":"<h1>Cleric</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Clerics are moral and spiritual leaders, warriors of faith who preach the will of the gods, interpret omens and portents, and strike down the evil or unfaithful. Most clerics have a patron deity, but some are champions of a particular moral alignment, venerating all deities of that alignment in addition to a patron deity, and yet others are the servants of a particular pantheon of deities. In a world of swords and sorcery, force of arms often speaks louder than moral suasion, and clerics are trained to do battle against the enemies of their gods. Some clerics are fanatics, zealously seeking new converts or hunting heretics. Others seem almost burdened by an inconvenient or even oppressive relationship with the divine forces. Evil clerics - sinister villains who prey upon fear and jealousy - sow discord in the world and gather converts for their demonic masters.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Clerics play an important support role for an adventuring party. Most clerical spells are oriented toward healing, strengthening, and defending others. However, when the need arises the cleric is fully capable of taking a place in the line of battle and smiting down infidels and foes. Clerics employ their holy symbols rather than spell books as a focus for their meditation. Cleric spells are automatically acquired as the cleric gains levels and no check is necessary to ensure they are understood; thus clerics may normally memorise any spell appropriate to their level. However, in some circumstances the powers the cleric serves may intervene and grant different spells to those requested; it is suggested that this is only done in extreme cases (such as when the cleric has been guilty of an alignment transgression of some kind, for example; more serious transgressions may result in fewer spells being granted, or even none at all). Some GMs may permit clerics of specific deities to have slightly different abilities from those described here.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>When a cleric attains ninth level, he or she has accumulated sufficient divine favour and mortal renown to found a temple/stronghold. Such places are normally carved from the wilderness, in the same manner as a fighter establishes a freehold. For a cleric to assume the leadership of an existing temple, the details are left to the discretion of the GM; a level somewhat higher than ninth might be required. Whether the cleric establishes a stronghold or a temple, followers and acolytes will flock to the cleric's banner.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>The Cleric Character</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Minimum Scores: Str 6, Dex 3, Con 6, Int 6, Wis 9, Cha 6</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Hit Die Type: [[/roll 1d8]] (max 9)</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Alignment: Any</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Experience bonus: Wisdom 16+</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Armour/Shield Permitted: Any</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Weapons Permitted: Blunt only - club, flail, hammer, mace, oil, staff; clerics may hurl hammers, clubs, or oil, but may not employ other missile weapons</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Weapon Proficiencies: 2+1 every 3 levels</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Penalty \"to hit\" for non-proficiency: -3</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Weapon Specialisation: N/A</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Cleric Class Abilities</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Spell Casting: </b>Clerics may memorise and cast clerical spells in accordance with the tables provided hereafter.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Turning Undead: </b>Clerics can \"turn\" the undead, making them flee from the cleric's holiness (or, in the case of an evil cleric, bringing them to heel as servants and minions).

Magic armour with a rating of +1 reduces AC by 1, +2 reduces by 2, and so forth; the principle is that a positive rating for a magic item shows that it is beneficial, but AC is rated on a descending scale whereby the lower the figure, the better the protection.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Shields do NOT affect armour class where the target is being attacked from the rear. Likewise, a figure attacked by several opponents may only employ the shield against one (in the case of a small shield), two (in the case of a medium shield) or three (for a large shield) attacks in any one given round; thus AC against multiple opponents will tend to deteriorate.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>This table should not be used to extrapolate monster armour types. These are assigned rather than calculated. For example, most hobgoblins are AC 5, but this does not mean that the hobgoblin will automatically be wearing chain mail armour worth 75gp! More than likely, the creature is wearing a mishmash of assorted pieces of armour of negligible value, but its armour class is considered to be 5 owing to its combat skill and the needs of the game system.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Field plate is optional, and rather anachronistic (and hence not listed on the standard tables). It means the Gothic and Milanese plate of the fifteenth century or later. If field plate is used in a campaign, it should be treated as having an AC modifier of -8 (i.e. field plate plus shield would be equivalent to AC 1) and a maximum movement rate of 90-ft. Some GMs may also wish to permit full plate, representing the jousting or tourney plate of the same period and later, which should be treated as having an AC modifier of -9 and a maximum movement rate of 60-ft.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Elfin mail counts as normal (chain) mail except for the purposes of weight calculation and encumbrance. It is rarely sold, but suits are occasionally fashioned by elven master craftsmen as gifts for those who have performed some great service for the elven race. 99% of them are awarded to elves, the majority of the remainder to humans or half-elves. Dwarf-sized or smaller suits are prohibitively rare.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Druids are restricted to armour that does not contain metal. They are permitted leather (optionally studded leather at the GM's discretion) and shields not bound with metal.

One should note only damage accumulated while wearing the ring can be healed by the ring's power. </u>Removing the ring of regeneration will naturally result in the cessation of the healing process. 10% of these rings (91-100 on d%) are a special type, called rings of vampiric regeneration. Vampiric rings do not regenerate any hp per turn, but will bestow half value of all damage(rounded down) inflicted upon one's opponents in hand-to-hand combat to the wearer of the ring.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<i>For example: </i>If the fighter Grabbo the Lusty inflicts 11 points of damage with his longsword upon his hobgoblin opponent while wearing a ring of vampiric regeneration, up to 5 hit points of Grabbo's damage will be immediately healed. This process works only with melee weapons; the ring cannot use damage caused by missile fire, hurled weapons, or spells.

Roll [[/roll 2d4]] to determine number of spells the ring can contain. To randomly determine the spell levels of each spell, roll [[/roll 1d6]] (on a result of 6 re-roll for level with [[/roll 1d4]]) for cleric, druid or illusionist spells, and [[/roll 1d8]] (on a result of 8 re-roll for level with [[/roll 1d6]]) for magic user spells. Once type, number, and level of spells is determined, the GM must decide which spells the ring contains. The spells can either be hand-picked or the GM may use the OSRIC magic tables and dice for spells randomly. Once the class of spells, their number and level, and the exact spells to be stored are determined, that capability can never be changed. Charging the ring requires a spell caster to cast the specific spell to be stored with the ring as the target of the spell.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<i>Example of Ring of Spell Storing Creation: </i>Jerry the GM decides to place a ring of spell storing in a red dragon's treasure hoard. He rolls a 57 on d%, indicating the ring contains magic user spells. A second d% roll yields a 05 and this means the ring really contains spells of the illusionist class. Jerry now rolls [[/roll 2d4]] and gets 1 on both dice, meaning the ring will contain 2 spells total. Jerry now rolls [[/roll 1d6]] twice, one for each spell to determine the level of that spell. The first result is a 2, the second is a 6. The 6 needs to be re-rolled on a [[/roll 1d4]] and rolling that die generates a result of 4. So, the GM now knows the ring will hold 2 illusionist spells, one of level 2 and one of level 4. Jerry decides to let fate take a hand in the selection of the exact spells the ring stores and takes a look at the illusionist spell tables (see Chapter 2). There are twelve level 2 illusionist spells, and eight level 4 spells, so Jerry grabs a [[/roll 1d12]] and a [[/roll 1d8]] and rolls them both. The [[/roll 1d12]] rolls a 4 so Jerry notes the result of detect magic. The [[/roll 1d8]] rolls an 8 and Jerry notes the result of shadow monsters. Now that the exact properties of the ring of spell storing have been determined, they can never be changed; the ring will ever after only hold the two illusionist spells noted. If the finder of the ring uses it to cast a detect magic spell, then an illusionist must cast a detect magic upon the ring to recharge that spell slot.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>[ <b><i>FG NOTE: </i></b><i>Whew - that example looks like it could be a lot of rolling.

I think it's fair to say that Matt wrote these words in fear and hope - fear that the document might not be received by the gaming public, balanced by the hope that we would achieve what we always intended: a revival of First Edition in print. I certainly believe that Matt's fears have been allayed, and his hopes wildly exceeded.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>I write this now with the advantage of considerable hindsight, and I can say that OSRIC's success has gone beyond anything we ever expected. I certainly never expected such demand for a print edition! And neither did I expect to receive so much help in drafting it.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>This document is a collaborative work from more than twenty artists, editors and authors, who have given freely of their time and expertise to bring it to you. I am immensely proud of it.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>There have been challenges along the way, and doubtless there are more to come, but nevertheless, OSRIC has reached the stage where I feel I can truly describe it as: First Edition Reborn. I hope there remain new heights to reach.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>I cannot thank everyone I ought to thank, or this book would be much longer. Writing OSRIC has been such a huge project, involving so many people, that it is quite beyond me to express my gratitude to every single one of you. So I hope you will forgive me for simply saying, if you contributed to OSRIC in some way - large or small, with advice, suggestions, or merely a kindly word of encouragement - then, thank you!</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<i>- Stuart Marshall</i>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><h1>Introduction and Purpose</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>This document represents a compilation of rules for old school-style fantasy gaming. The book is intended to reproduce underlying rules used in the late 1970s to early 1980s, which being rules are not subject to copyright, without using any of the copyrighted \"artistic presentation\" originally used to convey those rules. In creating this new \"artistic presentation,\" we have made use of the System Reference Document produced by Wizards of the Coast (\"WOTC\").</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The reason for going back to square one and restating the underlying rules is simple. It allows old school publishers (both commercial and fans) to reference the rules set forth in this document without making reference to any protected trademark. (This document is trademarked, but the use of the trademark is permitted under the terms of the OSRIC Open License - see below). By using this document in tandem with the Open Game License (\"OGL\") of WOTC, a publisher should be able to create products for old-school fantasy gaming and clearly refer to this particular rule set without violating the terms of the OGL.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Thus, in many ways, this entire book is nothing more than a tool for old-school writers, a stepping stone to put the original, non-copyrightable portion of the old-school rules into an open license, as permitted by law. Great pains have been taken to ensure that we have used none of the original artistic presentation, for we have the greatest possible respect for the authors who originally created these games.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>We considered the non-copyrightable rules to be the numerical algorithms that would be in a computer version of the game (most precedent in the area of game copyrights has come from computer games, not RPGs), and have included these and the relations between the results of the formulae. \"To hit\" numbers are a clear example. On the other hand, level titles other than \"name\" level are clearly artistic presentation and are excluded.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>When \"name\" level does not create a numerical effect such as taxes from a stronghold or the ability to improve fighting power with followers, we have not used name level titles, even though the titles themselves are generic words.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>In a few cases you may find that rules themselves have been clarified, or are more based on the SRD than on original rules (when it was difficult to separate rules from artistic presentation). The greatest difference is in the inclusion of some random factors into the experience progression.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"I0IQ9ef7ZhLd66iw":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"c86c17e059abfb89358eb1e6152076c696e4d4a7","sourceId":"JournalEntry.zFv2D8SvPPot3LcB","defaultPermission":2},"cf":{"id":"temp_df0epgupt6c","path":"OSRIC-PC#/CF_SEP/OSRIC#/CF_SEP/Explanatory Notes and Definitions of Terms","color":"#000000"}}}
